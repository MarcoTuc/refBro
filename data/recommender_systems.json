    "title": "Toward the next generation of recommender systems: a survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of the field of recommender systems and describes the current generation of recommendation methods that are usually classified into the following three main categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. This paper also describes various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations."

    "title": "Evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been evaluated in many, often incomparable, ways. In this article, we review the key decisions in evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems: the user tasks being evaluated, the types of analysis and datasets being used, the ways in which prediction quality is measured, the evaluation of prediction attributes other than quality, and the user-based evaluation of the system as a whole. In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes. Metrics within each equivalency class were strongly correlated, while metrics from different equivalency classes were uncorrelated."

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation --- collaborative filtering --- on the basis of implicit feedback."

    "title": "Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets",
    "abstract": "A common task of recommender systems is to improve customer experience through personalized recommendations based on prior implicit feedback. These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model."

    "title": "Item-based top-<i>N</i>recommendation algorithms",
    "abstract": "The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems ---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers, which in typical commercial applications can be several millions. To address these scalability concerns model-based recommendation techniques have been developed. These techniques analyze the user--item matrix to discover relations between the different items and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this article, we present one such class of model-based recommendation algorithms that first determines the similarities between the various items and then uses them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on eight real datasets shows that these item-based algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations with comparable or better quality."

    "abstract": "We investigate the use of dimensionality reduction to improve performance for a new class of data analysis software called \"recommender systems\".Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making product recommendations during a live customer interaction.These systems are achieving widespread success in E-commerce nowadays, especially with the advent of the Internet.The tremendous growth of customers and products poses three key challenges for recommender systems in the E-commerce domain.These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of customers and products, and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity.One successful recommender system technology is collaborative filtering, which works by matching customer preferences to other customers in making recommendations.Collaborative filtering has been shown to produce high quality recommendations, but the performance degrades with the number of customers and products.New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very largescale problems.This paper presents two different experiments where we have explored one technology called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of recommender system databases.Each experiment compares the quality of a recommender system using SVD with the quality of a recommender system using collaborative filtering.The first experiment compares the effectiveness of the two recommender systems at predicting consumer preferences based on a database of explicit ratings of products.The second experiment compares the effectiveness of the two recommender systems at producing Top-N lists based on a real-life customer purchase database from an E-Commerce site.Our experience suggests that SVD has the potential to meet many of the challenges of recommender systems, under certain conditions."

In this paper, aiming at providing a general method for improving recommender systems by incorporating social network information, we propose a matrix factorization framework with social regularization. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) We elaborate how social network information can benefit recommender systems; (2) We interpret the differences between social-based recommender systems and trust-aware recommender systems; (3) We coin the term Social Regularization to represent the social constraints on recommender systems, and we systematically illustrate how to design a matrix factorization objective function with social regularization; and (4) The proposed method is quite general, which can be easily extended to incorporate other contextual information, like social tags, etc. The empirical analysis on two large datasets demonstrates that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods."

    "title": "Factorization meets the neighborhood",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems provide users with personalized suggestions for products or services. These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data have led to state-of-the-art performance on recommender system benchmarks. However, making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains a challenge. Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm PinSage, which combines efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to generate embeddings using a trained model. We deploy PinSage at Pinterest and train it on 7.5 billion examples on a graph with 3 billion nodes representing pins and boards, and 18 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies and A/B tests, PinSage generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable deep learning and graph-based alternatives. To our knowledge, this is the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures."

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems improve access to relevant products and information by making personalized suggestions based on previous examples of a user's likes and dislikes. Most existing recommender systems use collaborative filtering methods that base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast,content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions.This approach has the advantage of being able to recommend previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can produce accurate recommendations."

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time."

    "title": "Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Learning vector representations (aka. embeddings) of users and items lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user's (or an item's) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect."

    "abstract": "Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow."

    "title": "SoRec",
    "abstract": "Data sparsity, scalability and prediction quality have been recognized as the three most crucial challenges that every collaborative filtering algorithm or recommender system confronts. Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings or even none at all. Moreover, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the social interactions or connections among users. In view of the exponential growth of information generated by online social networks, social network analysis is becoming important for many Web applications. Following the intuition that a person's social network will affect personal behaviors on the Web, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization to solve the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy problems by employing both users' social network information and rating records. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results shows that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the circumstance that users have made few or no ratings."

An empirical evaluation on Epinions.com dataset shows that Recommender Systems that make use of trust information are the most effective in term of accuracy while preserving a good coverage. This is especially evident on users who provided few ratings."

This approach supports multiple dimensions, profiling information, and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations. The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments. A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made, and the tradeoffs between the two are studied. Moreover, the article introduces a combined rating estimation method, which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the standard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere. Finally, the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach, using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance."

Most research up to this point has focused on improving the accuracy of recommender systems. We believe that not only has this narrow focus been misguided, but has even been detrimental to the field. The recommendations that are most accurate according to the standard metrics are sometimes not the recommendations that are most useful to users. In this paper, we propose informal arguments that the recommender community should move beyond the conventional accuracy metrics and their associated experimental methodologies. We propose new user-centric directions for evaluating recommender systems."

    "title": "Learning to recommend with social trust ensemble",
    "abstract": "As an indispensable technique in the field of Information Filtering, Recommender System has been well studied and developed both in academia and in industry recently. However, most of current recommender systems suffer the following problems: (1) The large-scale and sparse data of the user-item matrix seriously affect the recommendation quality. As a result, most of the recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. (2) The traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real world recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. In this framework, we coin the term Social Trust Ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches."

We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users."

These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework GraphRec."

    "abstract": "The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination a'x is already stationary, the time series x are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector a. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that a becomes a matrix. Interpreting a'x,= 0 as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets."

Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall)."

However, current recommender systems are black boxes, providing no transparency into the working of the recommendation. Explanations provide that transparency, exposing the reasoning and data behind a recommendation. In this paper, we address explanation interfaces for ACF systems - how they should be implemented and why they should be implemented. To explore how, we present a model for explanations based on the user's conceptual model of the recommendation process. We then present experimental results demonstrating what components of an explanation are the most compelling. To address why, we present experimental evidence that shows that providing explanations can improve the acceptance of ACF systems. We also describe some initial explorations into measuring how explanations can improve the filtering performance of users."

Even though existing work has suggested a wide range of criteria, the consistency and validity of the combined criteria have not been tested. In this paper, we describe a unifying evaluation framework, called ResQue (Recommender systems' Quality of user experience), which aimed at measuring the qualities of the recommended items, the system's usability, usefulness, interface and interaction qualities, users' satisfaction with the systems, and the influence of these qualities on users' behavioral intentions, including their intention to purchase the products recommended to them and return to the system. We also show the results of applying psychometric methods to validate the combined criteria using data collected from a large user survey. The outcomes of the validation are able to 1) support the consistency, validity and reliability of the selected criteria; and 2) explain the quality of user experience and the key determinants motivating users to adopt the recommender technology. The final model consists of thirty two questions and fifteen constructs, defining the essential qualities of an effective and satisfying recommender system, as well as providing practitioners and scholars with a cost-effective way to evaluate the success of a recommender system and identify important areas in which to invest development resources."

    "title": "An MDP-Based Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Typical recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model, must be solvable quickly, and should not consume too much memory. In this paper, we describe our particular MDP model, its initialization using a predictive model, the solution and update algorithm, and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know, it is the first to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site. These results validate the commercial value of recommender systems, and in particular, of our MDP-based approach."

    "title": "Factorization Machines",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Factorization Machines (FM) which are a new model class that combines the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with factorization models. Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models."

    "abstract": "Learning sophisticated feature interactions behind user behaviors is critical in maximizing CTR for recommender systems. Despite great progress, existing methods seem to have a strong bias towards low- or high-order interactions, or require expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we show that it is possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and high-order feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide &amp; Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its \"wide\" and \"deep\" parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and commercial data."

    "title": "Session-based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "We apply recurrent neural networks (RNN) on a new domain, namely recommender systems. Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches."

Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature."

We introduce the intra-list similarity metric to assess the topical diversity of recommendation lists and the topic diversification approach for decreasing the intra-list similarity. We evaluate our method using book recommendation data, including offline analysis on 361, !, 349 ratings and an online study involving more than 2, !, 100 subjects."

    "title": "Explaining the user experience of recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Research on recommender systems typically focuses on the accuracy of prediction algorithms. Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems."

    "title": "Collaborative Filtering beyond the User-Item Matrix",
    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, a large amount of research effort has been devoted to developing algorithms that generate recommendations. The resulting research progress has established the importance of the user-item (U-I) matrix, which encodes the individual preferences of users for items in a collection, for recommender systems. The U-I matrix provides the basis for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, the dominant framework for recommender systems. Currently, new recommendation scenarios are emerging that offer promising new information that goes beyond the U-I matrix. This information can be divided into two categories related to its source: rich side information concerning users and items, and interaction information associated with the interplay of users and items. In this survey, we summarize and analyze recommendation scenarios involving information sources and the CF algorithms that have been recently developed to address them. We provide a comprehensive introduction to a large body of research, more than 200 key references, with the aim of supporting the further development of recommender systems exploiting information beyond the U-I matrix. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss what we see as the central challenges lying ahead for recommender system technology, both in terms of extensions of existing techniques as well as of the integration of techniques and technologies drawn from other research areas."

And collaborative filtering techniques have proven to be an vital component of many such recommender systems as they facilitate the generation of high-quality recom-mendations by leveraging the preferences of communities of similar users. In this paper we suggest that the traditional emphasis on user similarity may be overstated. We argue that additional factors have an important role to play in guiding recommendation. Specifically we propose that the trustworthiness of users must be an important consideration. We present two computational models of trust and show how they can be readily incorporated into standard collaborative filtering frameworks in a variety of ways. We also show how these trust models can lead to improved predictive accuracy during recommendation."

    "title": "Factorizing personalized Markov chains for next-basket recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are an important component of many websites. Two of the most popular approaches are based on matrix factorization (MF) and Markov chains (MC). MF methods learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item preferences. On the other hand, MC methods model sequential behavior by learning a transition graph over items that is used to predict the next action based on the recent actions of a user. In this paper, we present a method bringing both approaches together. Our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying Markov chains. That means for each user an own transition matrix is learned - thus in total the method uses a transition cube. As the observations for estimating the transitions are usually very limited, our method factorizes the transition cube with a pairwise interaction model which is a special case of the Tucker Decomposition. We show that our factorized personalized MC (FPMC) model subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model. For learning the model parameters, we introduce an adaption of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) framework for sequential basket data. Empirically, we show that our FPMC model outperforms both the common matrix factorization and the unpersonalized MC model both learned with and without factorization."

This source of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems while it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets."

    "title": "Shilling recommender systems for fun and profit",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have emerged in the past several years as an effective way to help people cope with the problem of information overload. One application in which they have become particularly common is in e-commerce, where recommendation of items can often help a customer find what she is interested in and, therefore can help drive sales. Unscrupulous producers in the never-ending quest for market penetration may find it profitable to shill recommender systems by lying to the systems in order to have their products recommended more often than those of their competitors. This paper explores four open questions that may affect the effectiveness of such shilling attacks: which recommender algorithm is being used, whether the application is producing recommendations or predictions, how detectable the attacks are by the operator of the system, and what the properties are of the items being attacked. The questions are explored experimentally on a large data set of movie ratings. Taken together, the results of the paper suggest that new ways must be used to evaluate and detect shilling attacks on recommender systems."

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems---a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of N items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based Collaborative filtering is the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date, and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these methods grows linearly with the number of customers that in typical commercial applications can grow to be several millions. To address these scalability concerns item-based recommendation techniques have been developed that analyze the user-item matrix to identify relations between the different items, and use these relations to compute the list of recommendations.In this paper we present one such class of item-based recommendation algorithms that first determine the similarities between the various items and then used them to identify the set of items to be recommended. The key steps in this class of algorithms are (i) the method used to compute the similarity between the items, and (ii) the method used to combine these similarities in order to compute the similarity between a basket of items and a candidate recommender item. Our experimental evaluation on five different datasets show that the proposed item-based algorithms are up to 28 times faster than the traditional user-neighborhood based recommender systems and provide recommendations whose quality is up to 27% better."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems provide personalized suggestions about items that users will find interesting. Typically, recommender systems require a user interface that can ``intelligently'' determine the interest of a user and use this information to make suggestions. The common solution, ``explicit ratings'', where users tell the system what they think about a piece of information, is well-understood and fairly precise. However, having to stop to enter explicit ratings can alter normal patterns of browsing and reading. A more ``intelligent'' method is to useimplicit ratings, where a rating is obtained by a method other than obtaining it directly from the user. These implicit interest indicators have obvious advantages, including removing the cost of the user rating, and that every user interaction with the system can contribute to an implicit rating."

    "title": "Blockbuster Culture's Next Rise or Fall: The Impact of Recommender Systems on Sales Diversity",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences."

    "abstract": "The popularity of location-based social networks provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their location histories. In this paper, we present a location-based and preference-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (such as restaurants) within a geospatial range with the consideration of both: 1) User preferences, which are automatically learned from her location history and 2) Social opinions, which are mined from the location histories of the local experts. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near their living areas but also to a city that is new to them. As a user can only visit a limited number of locations, the user-locations matrix is very sparse, leading to a big challenge to traditional collaborative filtering-based location recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city. To this end, we propose a novel location recommender system, which consists of two main parts: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part models each individual's personal preferences with a weighted category hierarchy (WCH) and infers the expertise of each user in a city with respect to different category of locations according to their location histories using an iterative learning model. The online recommendation part selects candidate local experts in a geospatial range that matches the user's preferences using a preference-aware candidate selection algorithm and then infers a score of the candidate locations based on the opinions of the selected local experts. Finally, the top-k ranked locations are returned as the recommendations for the user. We evaluated our system with a large-scale real dataset collected from Foursquare. The results confirm that our method offers more effective recommendations than baselines, while having a good efficiency of providing location recommendations."

In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre-existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions."

    "title": "Collaborative Deep Learning for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems. Conventional CF-based methods use the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendation. However, the ratings are often very sparse in many applications, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. To address this sparsity problem, auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which tightly couples the two components that learn from two different sources of information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse. To address this problem, we generalize recently advances in deep learning from i.i.d. input to non-i.i.d. (CF-based) input and propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian model called collaborative deep learning (CDL), which jointly performs deep representation learning for the content information and collaborative filtering for the ratings (feedback) matrix. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets from different domains show that CDL can significantly advance the state of the art."

They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. This paper discusses a~wide variety of the choices available and their implications, aiming to provide both practicioners and researchers with an introduction to the important issues underlying recommenders and current best practices for addressing these issues."

As learning is taking place in extremely diverse and rich environments, the incorporation of contextual information about the user in the recommendation process has attracted major interest. Such contextualization is researched as a paradigm for building intelligent systems that can better predict and anticipate the needs of users, and act more efficiently in response to their behavior. In this paper, we try to assess the degree to which current work in TEL recommender systems has achieved this, as well as outline areas in which further work is needed. First, we present a context framework that identifies relevant context dimensions for TEL applications. Then, we present an analysis of existing TEL recommender systems along these dimensions.

For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews."

    "title": "Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict additional topics or products a new user might like. In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time."

    "title": "VBPR: Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback",
    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems model people and items by discovering or `teasing apart' the underlying dimensions that encode the properties of items and users' preferences toward them. Critically, such dimensions are uncovered based on user feedback, often in implicit form (such as purchase histories, browsing logs, etc.); in addition, some recommender systems make use of side information, such as product attributes, temporal information, or review text.However one important feature that is typically ignored by existing personalized recommendation and ranking methods is the visual appearance of the items being considered. In this paper we propose a scalable factorization model to incorporate visual signals into predictors of people's opinions, which we apply to a selection of large, real-world datasets. We make use of visual features extracted from product images using (pre-trained) deep networks, on top of which we learn an additional layer that uncovers the visual dimensions that best explain the variation in people's feedback. This not only leads to significantly more accurate personalized ranking methods, but also helps to alleviate cold start issues, and qualitatively to analyze the visual dimensions that influence people's opinions."

    "title": "Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Among different recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering usually suffer from limited performance due to the sparsity of user-item interactions. To address the issues, auxiliary information is usually used to boost the performance. Due to the rapid collection of information on the web, the knowledge base provides heterogeneous information including both structured and unstructured data with different semantics, which can be consumed by various applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage the heterogeneous information in a knowledge base to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the knowledge base, we design three components to extract items' semantic representations from structural content, textual content and visual content, respectively. To be specific, we adopt a heterogeneous network embedding method, termed as TransR, to extract items' structural representations by considering the heterogeneity of both nodes and relationships. We apply stacked denoising auto-encoders and stacked convolutional auto-encoders, which are two types of deep learning based embedding techniques, to extract items' textual representations and visual representations, respectively. Finally, we propose our final integrated framework, which is termed as Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding (CKE), to jointly learn the latent representations in collaborative filtering as well as items' semantic representations from the knowledge base. To evaluate the performance of each embedding component as well as the whole system, we conduct extensive experiments with two real-world datasets from different scenarios. The results reveal that our approaches outperform several widely adopted state-of-the-art recommendation methods."

    "title": "Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems, which seek to capture the 'context' of users' activities on the basis of actions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches have proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Markov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of just their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for longer-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods perform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical, while RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is affordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a self-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture long-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its predictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step, SASRec seeks to identify which items are 'relevant' from a user's action history, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies show that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models (including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets. Moreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable CNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our model adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful patterns in activity sequences."

    "title": "Is seeing believing?",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems use people's opinions about items in an information domain to help people choose other items. These systems have succeeded in domains as diverse as movies, news articles, Web pages, and wines. The psychological literature on conformity suggests that in the course of helping people make choices, these systems probably affect users' opinions of the items. If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items. We find that users rate fairly consistently across rating scales. Users can be manipulated, though, tending to rate toward the prediction the system shows, whether the prediction is accurate or not. However, users can detect systems that manipulate predictions. We discuss how designers of recommender systems might react to these findings."

Most online shopping sites and many other applications now use recommender systems.

    "title": "Session-based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Abstract: We apply recurrent neural networks (RNN) on a new domain, namely recommender systems. Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches."

Although numerous efforts have been made toward more personalized recommendations, recommender systems still suffer from several challenges, such as data sparsity and cold-start problems. In recent years, generating recommendations with the knowledge graph as side information has attracted considerable interest. Such an approach can not only alleviate the above mentioned issues for a more accurate recommendation, but also provide explanations for recommended items. In this paper, we conduct a systematical survey of knowledge graph-based recommender systems. We collect recently published papers in this field, and group them into three categories, i.e., embedding-based methods, connection-based methods, and propagation-based methods. Also, we further subdivide each category according to the characteristics of these approaches. Moreover, we investigate the proposed algorithms by focusing on how the papers utilize the knowledge graph for accurate and explainable recommendation. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field."

    "abstract": "Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep convolutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach."

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of (digital) cultural heritage artefacts offers great potential for increased access to art content, but also necessitates tools to help users deal with such abundance of information. User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (N = 60) evaluated interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users with artworks that are of interest to them, based on their ratings of other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent, version 2 explained to the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations. Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency. Showing how certain the system was of a recommendation did not influence trust and acceptance. A number of guidelines for design of recommender systems in the cultural heritage domain have been derived from the study\u2019s results."

Fortunately, with the continuous growth of online user reviews, the information available for training a recommender system is no longer limited to just numerical star ratings or user/item features. By extracting explicit user opinions about various aspects of a product from the reviews, it is possible to learn more details about what aspects a user cares, which further sheds light on the possibility to make explainable recommendations."

Different evaluation metrics have been reported in the literature but the precise relation, distinction or equivalence between them has not been explicitly studied. Furthermore, the metrics reported so far miss important properties such as taking into consideration the ranking of recommended items, or whether items are relevant or not, when assessing the novelty and diversity of recommendations."

The subtle semantics and non-linear dynamics of fashion evolution raise unique challenges especially considering the sparsity and large scale of the underlying datasets. In this paper we build novel models for the One-Class Collaborative Filtering setting, where our goal is to estimate users' fashion-aware personalized ranking functions based on their past feedback. To uncover the complex and evolving visual factors that people consider when evaluating products, our method combines high-level visual features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, users' past feedback, as well as evolving trends within the community. Experimentally we evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets from Amazon.com, where we show it to outperform state-of-the-art personalized ranking measures, and also use it to visualize the high-level fashion trends across the 11-year span of our dataset."

The approach presented in the paper splits the whole itemset into the head and the tail parts and clusters only the tail items. Then recommendations for the tail items are based on the ratings in these clusters and for the head items on the ratings of individual items. If such partition and clustering are done properly, we show that this reduces the recommendation error rates for the tail items, while maintaining reasonable computational performance."

Temporal dynamics are purely reactive, that is, they are inferred after they are observed, e.g. after a user's taste has changed or based on hand-engineered temporal bias corrections for movies. We propose Recurrent Recommender Networks (RRN) that are able to predict future behavioral trajectories. This is achieved by endowing both users and movies with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoregressive model that captures dynamics, in addition to a more traditional low-rank factorization. On multiple real-world datasets, our model offers excellent prediction accuracy and it is very compact, since we need not learn latent state but rather just the state transition function."

Online recommender systems - built on algorithms that attempt to predict which items users will most enjoy consuming - are one family of technologies that potentially suffers from this effect. Because recommender systems have become so prevalent, it is important to investigate their impact on users in these terms. This paper examines the longitudinal impacts of a collaborative filtering-based recommender system on users. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to measure the filter bubble effect in terms of content diversity at the individual level. We contribute a novel metric to measure content diversity based on information encoded in user-generated tags, and we present a new set of methods to examine the temporal effect of recommender systems on the user experience. We do find that recommender systems expose users to a slightly narrowing set of items over time. However, we also see evidence that users who actually consume the items recommended to them experience lessened narrowing effects and rate items more positively."

In economics, these two types of recommendations are referred to as substitutes and complements: substitutes are products that can be purchased instead of each other, while complements are products that can be purchased in addition to each other. Such relationships are essential as they help us to identify items that are relevant to a user's search."

However this method has two drawbacks: (1) its model complexity is exponential in the number of context variables and polynomial in the size of the factorization and (2) it only works for categorical context variables. On the other hand there is a large variety of fast but specialized recommender methods which lack the generality of context-aware methods."

MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation task. The two tasks are associated by crosscompress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that crosscompress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-the-art baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse."

    "title": "Collaborative filtering with temporal dynamics",
    "abstract": "Customer preferences for products are drifting over time. Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics should be a key when designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the eco-system intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance-decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too much signal when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long term patterns. The paradigm we offer is creating a model tracking the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. This allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie rating dataset by Netflix. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset."

Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems. We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment recommendations. We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients. The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure."

In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization model with neural network architecture. Firstly, we construct a user-item matrix with explicit ratings and non-preference implicit feedback. With this matrix as the input, we present a deep structure learning architecture to learn a common low dimensional space for the representations of users and items. Secondly, we design a new loss function based on binary cross entropy, in which we consider both explicit ratings and implicit feedback for a better optimization. The experimental results show the effectiveness of both our proposed model and the loss function. On several benchmark datasets, our model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance within different experimental settings."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a recommender system for both taxi drivers and people expecting to take a taxi, using the knowledge of 1) passengers' mobility patterns and 2) taxi drivers' picking-up/dropping-off behaviors learned from the GPS trajectories of taxicabs. First, this recommender system provides taxi drivers with some locations and the routes to these locations, toward which they are more likely to pick up passengers quickly (during the routes or in these locations) and maximize the profit of the next trip. Second, it recommends people with some locations (within a walking distance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above-mentioned knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model that estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests the recommendation. We build our system using historical trajectories generated by over 12,000 taxis during 110 days and validate the system with extensive evaluations including in-the-field user studies."

    "title": "RippleNet",
    "abstract": "To address the sparsity and cold start problem of collaborative filtering, researchers usually make use of side information, such as social networks or item attributes, to improve recommendation performance. This paper considers the knowledge graph as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet, an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the knowledge graph into recommender systems. Similar to actual ripples propagating on the water, RippleNet stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user's potential interests along links in the knowledge graph. The multiple \"ripples\" activated by a user's historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item, which could be used for predicting the final clicking probability. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that RippleNet achieves substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book and news recommendation, over several state-of-the-art baselines."

To validate this approach, we compare recommender system techniques with traditional regression methods such as logistic/linear regression by using educational data for intelligent tutoring systems.

Although people frequently encounter these algorithms because they are cheap to scale, we do not know how they compare to human judgment. Here, we compare computer recommender systems to human recommenders in a domain that affords humans many advantages: predicting which jokes people will find funny. We find that recommender systems outperform humans, whether strangers, friends, or family. Yet people are averse to relying on these recommender systems. This aversion partly stems from the fact that people believe the human recommendation process is easier to understand. It is not enough for recommender systems to be accurate, they must also be understood."

    "title": "Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "To alleviate sparsity and cold start problem of collaborative filtering based recommender systems, researchers and engineers usually collect attributes of users and items, and design delicate algorithms to exploit these additional information. In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines."

This non-linear probabilistic model enables us to go beyond the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models which still largely dominate collaborative filtering research.We introduce a generative model with multinomial likelihood and use Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. Despite widespread use in language modeling and economics, the multinomial likelihood receives less attention in the recommender systems literature. We introduce a different regularization parameter for the learning objective, which proves to be crucial for achieving competitive performance. Remarkably, there is an efficient way to tune the parameter using annealing. The resulting model and learning algorithm has information-theoretic connections to maximum entropy discrimination and the information bottleneck principle. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including two recently-proposed neural network approaches, on several real-world datasets. We also provide extended experiments comparing the multinomial likelihood with other commonly used likelihood functions in the latent factor collaborative filtering literature and show favorable results. Finally, we identify the pros and cons of employing a principled Bayesian inference approach and characterize settings where it provides the most significant improvements."

Attackers, who cannot be readily distinguished from ordinary users, may inject biased profiles in an attempt to force a system to \u201cadapt\u201d in a manner advantageous to them. Such attacks may lead to a degradation of user trust in the objectivity and accuracy of the system. Recent research has begun to examine the vulnerabilities and robustness of different collaborative recommendation techniques in the face of \u201cprofile injection\u201d attacks. In this article, we outline some of the major issues in building secure recommender systems, concentrating in particular on the modeling of attacks and their impact on various recommendation algorithms. We introduce several new attack models and perform extensive simulation-based evaluations to show which attacks are most successful and practical against common recommendation techniques. Our study shows that both user-based and item-based algorithms are highly vulnerable to specific attack models, but that hybrid algorithms may provide a higher degree of robustness. Using our formal characterization of attack models, we also introduce a novel classification-based approach for detecting attack profiles and evaluate its effectiveness in neutralizing attacks."

It is challenging to develop effective methods for HIN based recommendation in both extraction and exploitation of the information from HINs. Most of HIN based recommendation methods rely on path based similarity, which cannot fully mine latent structure features of users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding based approach for HIN based recommendation, called HERec. To embed HINs, we design a meta-path based random walk strategy to generate meaningful node sequences for network embedding. The learned node embeddings are first transformed by a set of fusion functions, and subsequently integrated into an extended matrix factorization (MF) model. The extended MF model together with fusion functions are jointly optimized for the rating prediction task. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HERec model. Moreover, we show the capability of the HERec model for the cold-start problem, and reveal that the transformed embedding information from HINs can improve the recommendation performance."

    "title": "Scalable Collaborative Filtering with Jointly Derived Neighborhood Interpolation Weights",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems based on collaborative filtering predict user preferences for products or services by learning past user-item relationships. A predominant approach to collaborative filtering is neighborhood based (\"k-nearest neighbors\"), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called \"global effects\" from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. Finally, we show how to apply these methods to the perceivably much slower user-oriented approach. To this end, we suggest a novel scheme for low dimensional embedding of the users. We evaluate these methods on the netflix dataset, where they deliver significantly better results than the commercial netflix cinematch recommender system."

Research into recommender systems has traditionally focused on accuracy, in particular how closely the recommender\u2019s predicted ratings are to the users\u2019 true ratings. However, it has been recognized that other recommendation qualities\u2014such as whether the list of recommendations is diverse and whether it contains novel items\u2014may have a significant impact on the overall quality of a recommender system. Consequently, in recent years, the focus of recommender systems research has shifted to include a wider range of \u201cbeyond accuracy\u201d objectives. In this article, we present a survey of the most discussed beyond-accuracy objectives in recommender systems research: diversity, serendipity, novelty, and coverage. We review the definitions of these objectives and corresponding metrics found in the literature. We also review works that propose optimization strategies for these beyond-accuracy objectives. Since the majority of works focus on one specific objective, we find that it is not clear how the different objectives relate to each other. Hence, we conduct a set of offline experiments aimed at comparing the performance of different optimization approaches with a view to seeing how they affect objectives other than the ones they are optimizing. We use a set of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms optimized for recall along with a number of reranking strategies for optimizing the diversity, novelty, and serendipity of the generated recommendations. For each reranking strategy, we measure the effects on the other beyond-accuracy objectives and demonstrate important insights into the correlations between the discussed objectives. For instance, we find that rating-based diversity is positively correlated with novelty, and we demonstrate the positive influence of novelty on recommendation coverage."

In a recent study, we demonstrated strong evidence for violations of the missing at random condition in a real recommender system. In this paper we present the first study of the effect of non-random missing data on collaborative ranking, and extend our previous results regarding the impact of non-random missing data on collaborative prediction."

The recommended results for a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended reasonably. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network (DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news recommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for click-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and word-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that fuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats words and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment relationship during convolution. In addition, to address users\u00bb diverse interests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a user\u00bbs history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive experiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models.

Online recommender systems - built on algorithms that attempt to predict which items users will most enjoy consuming - are one family of technologies that potentially suffers from this effect. Because recommender systems have become so prevalent, it is important to investigate their impact on users in these terms. This paper examines the longitudinal impacts of a collaborative filtering-based recommender system on users. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to measure the filter bubble effect in terms of content diversity at the individual level. We contribute a novel metric to measure content diversity based on information encoded in user-generated tags, and we present a new set of methods to examine the temporal effect of recommender systems on the user experience. We do find that recommender systems expose users to a slightly narrowing set of items over time. However, we also see evidence that users who actually consume the items recommended to them experience lessened narrowing effects and rate items more positively."

These algorithms typically perform differently in various domains and tasks. Therefore, it is important from the research perspective, as well as from a practical view, to be able to decide on an algorithm that matches the domain and the task of interest. The standard way to make such decisions is by comparing a number of algorithms offline using some evaluation metric. Indeed, many evaluation metrics have been suggested for comparing recommendation algorithms. The decision on the proper evaluation metric is often critical, as each metric may favor a different algorithm. In this paper we review the proper construction of offline experiments for deciding on the most appropriate algorithm. We discuss three important tasks of recommender systems, and classify a set of appropriate well known evaluation metrics for each task. We demonstrate how using an improper evaluation metric can lead to the selection of an improper algorithm for the task of interest.

Dietary fruits and vegetables are the principal source of ascorbate and carotenoids and are one source of tocopherol. Low dietary intake of fruits and vegetables doubles the risk of most types of cancer as compared to high intake and also markedly increases the risk of heart disease and cataracts.

Moreover, they need to serve billions of users, who are unique at any point in time, making a complex user state space. Luckily, huge quantities of logged implicit feedback (e.g., user clicks, dwell time) are available for learning. Learning from the logged feedback is however subject to biases caused by only observing feedback on recommendations selected by the previous versions of the recommender. In this work, we present a general recipe of addressing such biases in a production top-K recommender system at Youtube, built with a policy-gradient-based algorithm, i.e. REINFORCE. The contributions of the paper are: (1) scaling REINFORCE to a production recommender system with an action space on the orders of millions; (2) applying off-policy correction to address data biases in learning from logged feedback collected from multiple behavior policies; (3) proposing a novel top-K off-policy correction to account for our policy recommending multiple items at a time; (4) showcasing the value of exploration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches through a series of simulations and multiple live experiments on Youtube."

In particular we show how measuring fairness based on pairwise comparisons from randomized experiments provides a tractable means to reason about fairness in rankings from recommender systems. Building on this metric, we offer a new regularizer to encourage improving this metric during model training and thus improve fairness in the resulting rankings. We apply this pairwise regularization to a large-scale, production recommender system and show that we are able to significantly improve the system's pairwise fairness."

    "title": "Unifying Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation: Towards a Better Understanding of User Preferences",
    "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graph (KG) into recommender system is promising in improving the recommendation accuracy and explainability. However, existing methods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the \"knowledge\" in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This may lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be complete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and entities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature of KG when incorporating it into recommender system. In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge graph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we transfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a user likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies directed by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director relation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to understand the user's preference at a finer granularity. Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model, which specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an item, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several transfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods. Further analysis verifies the positive effect of joint training on both tasks of recommendation and KG completion, and the advantage of our model in understanding user preference.

And, a number of recent works have shown that this information can be used to build richer individual user models and to discover additional behavioral patterns that can be leveraged in the recommendation process. In this work, we review existing works that consider information from such sequentially ordered user-item interaction logs in the recommendation process. Based on this review, we propose a categorization of the corresponding recommendation tasks and goals, summarize existing algorithmic solutions, discuss methodological approaches when benchmarking what we call sequence-aware recommender systems , and outline open challenges in the area."

First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1) the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75 subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count, cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of recommendation."

    "title": "<i>TrustWalker</i>",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to build recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. However, it cannot make recommendations for so-called cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Trust-based recommendation methods assume the additional knowledge of a trust network among users and can better deal with cold start users, since users only need to be simply connected to the trust network. On the other hand, the sparsity of the user item ratings forces the trust-based approach to consider ratings of indirect neighbors that are only weakly trusted, which may decrease its precision. In order to find a good trade-off, we propose a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation. The random walk model allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset and compared our model with existing trust-based and collaborative filtering methods."

    "title": "Beyond accuracy",
    "abstract": "When we evaluate the quality of recommender systems (RS), most approaches only focus on the predictive accuracy of these systems. Recent works suggest that beyond accuracy there is a variety of other metrics that should be considered when evaluating a RS. In this paper we focus on two crucial metrics in RS evaluation: coverage and serendipity. Based on a literature review, we first discuss both measurement methods as well as the trade-off between good coverage and serendipity. We then analyze the role of coverage and serendipity as indicators of recommendation quality, present novel ways of how they can be measured and discuss how to interpret the obtained measurements. Overall, we argue that our new ways of measuring these concepts reflect the quality impression perceived by the user in a better way than previous metrics thus leading to enhanced user satisfaction."

    "title": "NAIS: Neural Attentive Item Similarity Model for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Item-to-item collaborative filtering (aka.item-based CF) has been long used for building recommender systems in industrial settings, owing to its interpretability and efficiency in real-time personalization. It builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile. As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF. In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF. The key to our design of NAIS is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM) [1] , our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NAIS. This work is the first attempt that designs neural network models for item-based CF, opening up new research possibilities for future developments of neural recommender systems."

    "abstract": "The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions."

    "title": "LARS: A Location-Aware Recommender System",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes LARS, a location-aware recommender system that uses location-based ratings to produce recommendations. Traditional recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor items, LARS, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS can apply these techniques separately, or in concert, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the Movie Lens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches."

    "title": "Session-based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "We apply recurrent neural networks (RNN) on a new domain, namely recommender systems. Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches."

    "title": "Sequential Recommendation with User Memory Networks",
    "abstract": "User preferences are usually dynamic in real-world recommender systems, and a user\u00bbs historical behavior records may not be equally important when predicting his/her future interests. Existing recommendation algorithms -- including both shallow and deep approaches -- usually embed a user\u00bbs historical records into a single latent vector/representation, which may have lost the per item- or feature-level correlations between a user\u00bbs historical records and future interests. In this paper, we aim to express, store, and manipulate users\u00bb historical records in a more explicit, dynamic, and effective manner. To do so, we introduce the memory mechanism to recommender systems. Specifically, we design a memory-augmented neural network (MANN) integrated with the insights of collaborative filtering for recommendation. By leveraging the external memory matrix in MANN, we store and update users\u00bb historical records explicitly, which enhances the expressiveness of the model. We further adapt our framework to both item- and feature-level versions, and design the corresponding memory reading/writing operations according to the nature of personalized recommendation scenarios. Compared with state-of-the-art methods that consider users\u00bb sequential behavior for recommendation, e.g., sequential recommenders with recurrent neural networks (RNN) or Markov chains, our method achieves significantly and consistently better performance on four real-world datasets. Moreover, experimental analyses show that our method is able to extract the intuitive patterns of how users\u00bb future actions are affected by previous behaviors."

    "abstract": "Online news reading has become very popular as the web provides access to news articles from millions of sources around the world. A key challenge of news websites is to help users find the articles that are interesting to read. In this paper, we present our research on developing personalized news recommendation system in Google News. For users who are logged in and have explicitly enabled web history, the recommendation system builds profiles of users' news interests based on their past click behavior. To understand how users' news interests change over time, we first conducted a large-scale analysis of anonymized Google News users click logs. Based on the log analysis, we developed a Bayesian framework for predicting users' current news interests from the activities of that particular user and the news trends demonstrated in the activity of all users. We combine the content-based recommendation mechanism which uses learned user profiles with an existing collaborative filtering mechanism to generate personalized news recommendations. The hybrid recommender system was deployed in Google News. Experiments on the live traffic of Google News website demonstrated that the hybrid method improves the quality of news recommendation and increases traffic to the site."

    "title": "Improving pairwise learning for item recommendation from implicit feedback",
    "abstract": "Pairwise algorithms are popular for learning recommender systems from implicit feedback. For each user, or more generally context, they try to discriminate between a small set of selected items and the large set of remaining (irrelevant) items. Learning is typically based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with uniformly drawn pairs. In this work, we show that convergence of such SGD learning algorithms slows down considerably if the item popularity has a tailed distribution. We propose a non-uniform item sampler to overcome this problem. The proposed sampler is context-dependent and oversamples informative pairs to speed up convergence. An efficient implementation with constant amortized runtime costs is developed. Furthermore, it is shown how the proposed learning algorithm can be applied to a large class of recommender models. The properties of the new learning algorithm are studied empirically on two real-world recommender system problems. The experiments indicate that the proposed adaptive sampler improves the state-of-the art learning algorithm largely in convergence without negative effects on prediction quality or iteration runtime."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems provide users with personalized suggestions for products or services. These systems often rely on collaborating filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The most common approach to CF is based on neighborhood models, which originate from similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce a new neighborhood model with an improved prediction accuracy. Unlike previous approaches that are based on heuristic similarities, we model neighborhood relations by minimizing a global cost function. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the model to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. Past models were limited by the need to compute all pairwise similarities between items or users, which grow quadratically with input size. In particular, this limitation vastly complicates adopting user similarity models, due to the typical large number of users. Our new model solves these limitations by factoring the neighborhood model, thus making both item-item and user-user implementations scale linearly with the size of the data. The methods are tested on the Netflix data, with encouraging results."

Even though the recent recommender systems are eminent in giving precise recommendations, they suffer from various limitations and challenges like scalability, cold-start, sparsity, etc. Due to the existence of various techniques, the selection of techniques becomes a complex work while building application-focused recommender systems. In addition, each technique comes with its own set of features, advantages and disadvantages which raises even more questions, which should be addressed. This paper aims to undergo a systematic review on various recent contributions in the domain of recommender systems, focusing on diverse applications like books, movies, products, etc. Initially, the various applications of each recommender system are analysed. Then, the algorithmic analysis on various recommender systems is performed and a taxonomy is framed that accounts for various components required for developing an effective recommender system. In addition, the datasets gathered, simulation platform, and performance metrics focused on each contribution are evaluated and noted. Finally, this review provides a much-needed overview of the current state of research in this field and points out the existing gaps and challenges to help posterity in developing an efficient recommender system."

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of Web contents, Recommender System has become indispensable for discovering new information that might interest Web users. Despite their success in the industry, traditional recommender systems suffer from several problems. First, the sparseness of the user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems. (2) In terms of the trust relations, distinct from previous trust-aware recommender systems which are based on some heuristics, we systematically interpret how to constrain the objective function with trust regularization. (3) The experimental results show that the distrust relations among users are as important as the trust relations. The complexity analysis shows our method scales linearly with the number of observations, while the empirical analysis on a large Epinions dataset proves that our approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications."

    "title": "Comparing Recommendations Made by Online Systems and Friends.",
    "abstract": "The quality of recommendations and usability of six online recommender systems (RS) was examined. Three book RS (Amazon.com, RatingZone & Sleeper) and three movie RS (Amazon.com, MovieCritic, Reel.com) were evaluated. Quality of recommendations was explored by comparing recommendations made by RS to recommendations made by the user\u2019s friends. Results showed that the user\u2019s friends consistently provided better recommendations than RS. However, users did find items recommended by online RS useful: recommended items were often \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d, while the items recommended by friends mostly served as reminders of previously identified interests. Usability evaluation of the RS showed that users did not mind providing more input to the system in order to get better recommendations. Also users trusted a system more if it recommended items that they had previously liked. A common way for people to decide what books to read is to ask friends and acquaintances for recommendations. The logic behind this time-tested method is that one shares tastes in books, movies, music etc., with one\u2019s friends. As such, items that appeal to them (friends) might appeal to me. Online Recommender Systems (RS) attempt to create a technological proxy for this social filtering process. The assumption behind many RS is that a good way to personalize recommendations for a user is to identify people with similar interests and recommend items that have interested these like-minded people (Resnick & Varian (1997), Goldberg, Nichols, Oki & Terry (1992)). This premise forms the statistical basis of most collaborative filtering algorithms. Since the goal of most RS is to replace (or at least augment) what is essentially a social process, we decided to directly compare the two ways of receiving recommendations (friends & online RS). Do users like receiving recommendations from an online system? How do the recommendations provided by online systems differ from those provided by the users\u2019 friends? Our hypothesis was that friends would make superior recommendations since they know the user well, and have intimate knowledge of his / her tastes in a number of domains. In contrast, RS only have limited, domain-specific knowledge about the users. Also, information retrieval systems do not yet match the sophistication of human judgment processes."

We design and evaluate algorithms that predict users' ratings for movies based on their inferred tag preferences.

To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF."

Collaborative Filtering (CF), the best known technology for recommender systems, is based on the idea that a set of like-minded users can help each other find useful information. A new user poses a challenge to CF recommenders, since the system has no knowledge about the preferences of the new user, and therefore cannot provide personalized recommendations. A new user preference elicitation strategy needs to ensure that the user does not a) abandon a lengthy signup process, and b) lose interest in returning to the site due to the low quality of initial recommendations. We extend the work of [23] in this paper by incrementally developing a set of information theoretic strategies for the new user problem. We propose an offline simulation framework, and evaluate the strategies through extensive offline simulations and an online experiment with real users of a live recommender system."

    "abstract": "Online retailers are increasingly using information technologies to provide value-added services to customers. Prominent examples of these services are online recommender systems and consumer feedback mechanisms, both of which serve to reduce consumer search costs and uncertainty associated with the purchase of unfamiliar products. The central question we address is how recommender systems affect sales. We take into consideration the interaction among recommendations, sales, and price. We then develop a robust empirical model that incorporates the indirect effect of recommendations on sales through retailer pricing, potential simultaneity between sales and recommendations, and a comprehensive measure of the strength of recommendations. Applying the model to a panel data set collected from two online retailers, we found that the strength of recommendations has a positive effect on sales. Moreover, this effect is moderated by the recency effect, where more recently released recommended items positively affect the cross-selling efforts of sellers. We also show that recommender systems help to reinforce the long-tail phenomenon of electronic commerce, and obscure recommendations positively affect cross-selling. We also found a positive effect of recommendations on prices. These results suggest that recommendations not only improve sales but they also provide added flexibility to retailers to adjust their prices. A comparative analysis reveals that recommendations have a higher effect on sales than does consumer feedback. Our empirical results show that providing value-added services, such as digital word of mouth and recommendations, allows retailers to charge higher prices while at the same time increasing demand by providing more information regarding the quality and match of products."

    "abstract": "The collaborative filtering approach to recommender systems predicts user preferences for products or services by learning past user-item relationships. In this work, we propose novel algorithms for predicting user ratings of items by integrating complementary models that focus on patterns at different scales. At a local scale, we use a neighborhood-based technique that infers ratings from observed ratings by similar users or of similar items. Unlike previous local approaches, our method is based on a formal model that accounts for interactions within the neighborhood, leading to improved estimation quality. At a higher, regional, scale, we use SVD-like matrix factorization for recovering the major structural patterns in the user-item rating matrix. Unlike previous approaches that require imputations in order to fill in the unknown matrix entries, our new iterative algorithm avoids imputation. Because the models involve estimation of millions, or even billions, of parameters, shrinkage of estimated values to account for sampling variability proves crucial to prevent overfitting. Both the local and the regional approaches, and in particular their combination through a unifying model, compare favorably with other approaches and deliver substantially better results than the commercial Netflix Cinematch recommender system on a large publicly available data set."

    "title": "World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour",
    "abstract": "Objectives To describe new WHO 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations. Results The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150\u2013300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75\u2013150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold. Conclusion These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018\u20132030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets."

    "title": "Temporal diversity in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms, used to build web-based recommender systems, are often evaluated in terms of how accurately they predict user ratings. However, current evaluation techniques disregard the fact that users continue to rate items over time: the temporal characteristics of the system's top-N recommendations are not investigated. In particular, there is no means of measuring the extent that the same items are being recommended to users over and over again. In this work, we show that temporal diversity is an important facet of recommender systems, by showing how CF data changes over time and performing a user survey. We then evaluate three CF algorithms from the point of view of the diversity in the sequence of recommendation lists they produce over time. We examine how a number of characteristics of user rating patterns (including profile size and time between rating) affect diversity. We then propose and evaluate set methods that maximise temporal recommendation diversity without extensively penalising accuracy."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is the fastest growing field in computer science, and health informatics is among the greatest challenges. The goal of ML is to develop algorithms which can learn and improve over time and can be used for predictions. Most ML researchers concentrate on automatic machine learning (aML), where great advances have been made, for example, in speech recognition, recommender systems, or autonomous vehicles. Automatic approaches greatly benefit from big data with many training sets. However, in the health domain, sometimes we are confronted with a small number of data sets or rare events, where aML-approaches suffer of insufficient training samples. Here interactive machine learning (iML) may be of help, having its roots in reinforcement learning, preference learning, and active learning. The term iML is not yet well used, so we define it as \"algorithms that can interact with agents and can optimize their learning behavior through these interactions, where the agents can also be human.\" This \"human-in-the-loop\" can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, e.g., subspace clustering, protein folding, or k-anonymization of health data, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of samples. Therefore, what would otherwise be an NP-hard problem, reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a human agent involved in the learning phase."

    "abstract": "To revise 1998 recommendations on childhood obesity, an Expert Committee, comprised of representatives from 15 professional organizations, appointed experienced scientists and clinicians to 3 writing groups to review the literature and recommend approaches to prevention, assessment, and treatment. Because effective strategies remain poorly defined, the writing groups used both available evidence and expert opinion to develop the recommendations. Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits. Providers can provide obesity prevention messages for most children and suggest weight control interventions for those with excess weight. The writing groups also recommend changing office systems so that they support efforts to address the problem. BMI should be calculated and plotted at least annually, and the classification should be integrated with other information such as growth pattern, familial obesity, and medical risks to assess the child's obesity risk. For prevention, the recommendations include both specific eating and physical activity behaviors, which are likely to promote maintenance of healthy weight, but also the use of patient-centered counseling techniques such as motivational interviewing, which helps families identify their own motivation for making change. For assessment, the recommendations include methods to screen for current medical conditions and for future risks, and methods to assess diet and physical activity behaviors. For treatment, the recommendations propose 4 stages of obesity care; the first is brief counseling that can be delivered in a health care office, and subsequent stages require more time and resources. The appropriateness of higher stages is influenced by a patient's age and degree of excess weight. These recommendations recognize the importance of social and environmental change to reduce the obesity epidemic but also identify ways healthcare providers and health care systems can be part of broader efforts."

In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for memory-based CF (PMCF). While this framework has clear links with classical memory-based CF, it allows us to find principled solutions to known problems of CF-based recommender systems. In particular, we show that a probabilistic active learning method can be used to actively query the user, thereby solving the \"new user problem.\" Furthermore, the probabilistic framework allows us to reduce the computational cost of memory-based CF by working on a carefully selected subset of user profiles, while retaining high accuracy. We report experimental results based on two real-world data sets, which demonstrate that our proposed PMCF framework allows an accurate and efficient prediction of user preferences."

This recommendation could be an on-line activity such as doing an exercise, reading posted messages on a conferencing system, or running an on-line simulation, or could be simply a web resource. These recommendation systems have been tried in e-commerce to entice purchasing of goods, but haven't been tried in e-learning. This paper suggests the use of web mining techniques to build such an agent that could recommend on-line learning activities or shortcuts in a course web site based on learners' access history to improve course material navigation as well as assist the online learning process. These techniques are considered integrated web mining as opposed to off-line web mining used by expert users to discover on-line access patterns."

HIN based recommenders face two problems: how to represent the high-level semantics of recommendations and how to fuse the heterogeneous information to make recommendations. In this paper, we solve the two problems by first introducing the concept of meta-graph to HIN-based recommendation, and then solving the information fusion problem with a \"matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM)\" approach. For the similarities generated by each meta-graph, we perform standard MF to generate latent features for both users and items. With different meta-graph based features, we propose to use FM with Group lasso (FMG) to automatically learn from the observed ratings to effectively select useful meta-graph based features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Yelp, show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art FM and other HIN-based recommendation algorithms."

    "title": "A Neural Influence Diffusion Model for Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users, with these trusted users are influenced by the trusted users' social connections. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could be applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than 13% performance improvements over the best baselines for top-10 recommendation on the two datasets."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are widely used in online e-commerce applications to improve user engagement and then to increase revenue. A key challenge for recommender systems is providing high quality recommendation to users in ``cold-start\" situations. We consider three types of cold-start problems: 1) recommendation on existing items for new users; 2) recommendation on new items for existing users; 3) recommendation on new items for new users. We propose predictive feature-based regression models that leverage all available information of users and items, such as user demographic information and item content features, to tackle cold-start problems. The resulting algorithms scale efficiently as a linear function of the number of observations. We verify the usefulness of our approach in three cold-start settings on the MovieLens and EachMovie datasets, by comparing with five alternatives including random, most popular, segmented most popular, and two variations of Vibes affinity algorithm widely used at Yahoo! for recommendation."

    "abstract": "Recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries is a challenging problem arising in many real applications, such as image inpainting and recommender systems. Many existing approaches formulate this problem as a general low-rank matrix approximation problem. Since the rank operator is nonconvex and discontinuous, most of the recent theoretical studies use the nuclear norm as a convex relaxation. One major limitation of the existing approaches based on nuclear norm minimization is that all the singular values are simultaneously minimized, and thus the rank may not be well approximated in practice. In this paper, we propose to achieve a better approximation to the rank of matrix by truncated nuclear norm, which is given by the nuclear norm subtracted by the sum of the largest few singular values. In addition, we develop a novel matrix completion algorithm by minimizing the Truncated Nuclear Norm. We further develop three efficient iterative procedures, TNNR-ADMM, TNNR-APGL, and TNNR-ADMMAP, to solve the optimization problem. TNNR-ADMM utilizes the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while TNNR-AGPL applies the accelerated proximal gradient line search method (APGL) for the final optimization. For TNNR-ADMMAP, we make use of an adaptive penalty according to a novel update rule for ADMM to achieve a faster convergence rate. Our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms on both synthetic and real visual datasets."

The availability of spatial, temporal and social information in online LBSNs offers an unprecedented opportunity to study various aspects of human behavior, and enable a variety of location-based services such as location recommendation. Previous work studied spatial and social influences on location recommendation in LBSNs. Due to the strong correlations between a user's check-in time and the corresponding check-in location, recommender systems designed for location recommendation inevitably need to consider temporal effects. In this paper, we introduce a novel location recommendation framework, based on the temporal properties of user movement observed from a real-world LBSN dataset. The experimental results exhibit the significance of temporal patterns in explaining user behavior, and demonstrate their power to improve location recommendation performance."

From current systems, a list of 400 ways of coping was compiled. For constructing lower order categories, the authors concluded that confirmatory factor analysis should replace the 2 most common strategies (exploratory factor analysis and rational sorting). For higher order categories, they recommend that the 3 most common distinctions (problem- vs. emotion-focused, approach vs. avoidance, and cognitive vs. behavioral) no longer be used. Instead, the authors recommend hierarchical systems of action types (e.g., proximity seeking, accommodation). From analysis of 6 such systems, 13 potential core families of coping were identified. Future steps involve deciding how to organize these families, using their functional homogeneity and distinctiveness, and especially their links to adaptive processes."

Researchers have indicated that integrated medical information systems are becoming an essential part of the modern healthcare systems. Such systems have evolved to an integrated enterprise-wide system. In particular, such systems are considered as a type of enterprise information systems or ERP system addressing healthcare industry sector needs. As part of efforts, nursing care plan recommender systems can provide clinical decision support, nursing education, clinical quality control, and serve as a complement to existing practice guidelines. We propose to use correlations among nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions to create a recommender system for constructing nursing care plans. In the current study, we used nursing diagnosis data to develop the methodology. Our system utilises a prefix-tree structure common in itemset mining to construct a ranked list of suggested care plan items based on previously-entered items. Unlike common commercial systems, our system makes sequential recommendations based on user interaction, modifying a ranked list of suggested items at each step in care plan construction. We rank items based on traditional association-rule measures such as support and confidence, as well as a novel measure that anticipates which selections might improve the quality of future rankings. Since the multi-step nature of our recommendations presents problems for traditional evaluation measures, we also present a new evaluation method based on average ranking position and use it to test the effectiveness of different recommendation strategies."

Such systems leverage knowledge about the known preferences of multiple users to recommend items of interest to other users. CF methods have been harnessed to make recommendations about such items as web pages, movies, books, and toys. Researchers have proposed and evaluated many approaches for generating recommendations. We describe and evaluate a new method called diagnosis (PD). Given a user's preferences for some items, we compute the probability that he or she is of the same personality type as other users, and, in turn, the probability that he or she will like new items. PD retains some of the advantages of traditional similarity-weighting techniques in that all data is brought to bear on each prediction and new data can be added easily and incrementally. Additionally, PD has a meaningful probabilistic interpretation, which may be leveraged to justify, explain, and augment results. We report empirical results on the EachMovie database of movie ratings, and on user profile data collected from the CiteSeer digital library of Computer Science research papers. The probabilistic framework naturally supports a variety of descriptive measurements--in particular, we consider the applicability of a value of information (VOI) computation."

In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms \u2013 contextual prefiltering, post-filtering, and modeling \u2013 for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several contextaware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach.

Facing withthe extreme sparsity, traditional models may limit their capacityof mining shallow patterns from the data, i.e. low-order featurecombinations. Deep models like deep neural networks, on theother hand, cannot be directly applied for the high-dimensionalinput because of the huge feature space. In this paper, we proposea Product-based Neural Networks (PNN) with an embeddinglayer to learn a distributed representation of the categorical data, a product layer to capture interactive patterns between interfieldcategories, and further fully connected layers to explorehigh-order feature interactions. Our experimental results on twolarge-scale real-world ad click datasets demonstrate that PNNsconsistently outperform the state-of-the-art models on various metrics."

Attackers can use automated means to inject a large number of biased profiles into such a system, resulting in recommendations that favor or disfavor given items. Since collaborative recommender systems must be open to user input, it is difficult to design a system that cannot be so attacked. Researchers studying robust recommendation have therefore begun to identify types of attacks and study mechanisms for recognizing and defeating them. In this paper, we propose and study different attributes derived from user profiles for their utility in attack detection. We show that a machine learning classification approach that includes attributes derived from attack models is more successful than more generalized detection algorithms previously studied."

Much research has focused on advancing recommendation technologies to improve accuracy of predictions, although behavioral aspects of using recommender systems are often overlooked. In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Viewers' preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system. These general findings have a number of important implications (e.g., on recommender systems performance metrics and design, preference bias, potential strategic behavior, and trust), which are discussed."

We propose a unified probabilistic framework for merging collaborative and content-based recommendations. We extend Hofmann's [1999] aspect model to incorporate three-way co-occurrence data among users, items, and item content. The relative influence of collaboration data versus content data is not imposed as an exogenous parameter, but rather emerges naturally from the given data sources. Global probabilistic models coupled with standard Expectation Maximization (EM) learning algorithms tend to drastically overfit in sparse-data situations, as is typical in recommendation applications. We show that secondary content information can often be used to overcome sparsity. Experiments on data from the ResearchIndex library of Computer Science publications show that appropriate mixture models incorporating secondary data produce significantly better quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Global probabilistic models also allow more general inferences than local methods like k-NN."

To identify a user's preference in the cold state, existing recommender systems, such as Netflix, initially provide items to a user; we call those items evidence candidates. Recommendations are then made based on the items selected by the user. Previous recommendation studies have two limitations: (1) the users who consumed a few items have poor recommendations and (2) inadequate evidence candidates are used to identify user preferences. We propose a meta-learning-based recommender system called MeLU to overcome these two limitations. From meta-learning, which can rapidly adopt new task with a few examples, MeLU can estimate new user's preferences with a few consumed items. In addition, we provide an evidence candidate selection strategy that determines distinguishing items for customized preference estimation. We validate MeLU with two benchmark datasets, and the proposed model reduces at least 5.92% mean absolute error than two comparative models on the datasets. We also conduct a user study experiment to verify the evidence selection strategy."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are collecting and analyzing user data to provide better user experience. However, several privacy concerns have been raised when a recommender knows user's set of items or their ratings. A number of solutions have been suggested to improve privacy of legacy recommender systems, but the existing solutions in the literature can protect either items or ratings only. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that protects both user's items and ratings. For this, we develop novel matrix factorization algorithms under local differential privacy (LDP). In a recommender system with LDP, individual users randomize their data themselves to satisfy differential privacy and send the perturbed data to the recommender. Then, the recommender computes aggregates of the perturbed data. This framework ensures that both user's items and ratings remain private from the recommender. However, applying LDP to matrix factorization typically raises utility issues with i) high dimensionality due to a large number of items and ii) iterative estimation algorithms. To tackle these technical challenges, we adopt dimensionality reduction technique and a novel binary mechanism based on sampling. We additionally introduce a factor that stabilizes the perturbed gradients. With MovieLens and LibimSeTi datasets, we evaluate recommendation accuracy of our recommender system and demonstrate that our algorithm performs better than the existing differentially private gradient descent algorithm for matrix factorization under stronger privacy requirements."

In this study, context-aware recommender systems perceive the user\u2019s location, time, and company. The context-based recommender system retrieves patterns from World Wide Web-based on the user\u2019s past interactions and provides future news recommendations. We have presented different techniques to support media recommendations for smartphones, to create a framework for context-aware, to filter E-learning content, and to deliver convenient news to the user. To achieve this goal, we have used content-based, collaborative filtering, a hybrid recommender system, and implemented a Web ontology language (OWL). We have also used the Resource Description Framework (RDF), JAVA, machine learning, semantic mapping rules, and natural ontology languages that suggest user items related to the search. In our work, we have used E-paper to provide users with the required news. After applying the semantic reasoning approach, we have concluded that by some means, this approach works similarly as a content-based recommender system since by taking the gain of a semantic approach, we can also recommend items according to the user\u2019s interests.

Within the ecosystem intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too many signals when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long-term patterns. We show how to model the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. Such a model allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie-rating dataset underlying the Netflix Prize contest. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset. In particular, methods described in this paper play a significant role in the solution that won the Netflix contest."

    "abstract": "Sponsors asked the IOM's Food and Nutrition Board and the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education Board on Children, Youth, and Families to review and update the IOM (1990) recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy and recommend ways to encourage their adoption through consumer education, strategies to assist practitioners, and public health strategies.The committee was asked to address the following tasks: 1. Review evidence on the relationship between weight gain patterns before, during, and after pregnancy and maternal and child health outcomes, with particular attention to the prevalence of maternal obesity racial/ethnic and age differences, components of GWG, and implications of weight during pregnancy on postpartum weight retention, maternal and child obesity, and later child health. 2. Within a life-stage framework consider factors in relation to GWG that are associated with maternal health outcomes such as lactation performance, postpartum weight retention, cardiovascular disease, metabolic processes including glucose and insulin-related issues, and risk of other chronic diseases; for infants and children, in addition to low birth weight, consider early developmental impacts and obesity-related consequences (e.g., mental health, diabetes). 3. Recommend revisions to the existing guidelines, where necessary, including the need for specific pregnancy weight guidelines for underweight, normal weight, and overweight and obese women and adolescents and women carrying twins or higher-order multiples. 4. Consider a range of approaches to promote appropriate weight gain, including: individual (behavior), psychosocial, community, health care, and health systems; timing and components of interventions; and ways to enhance awareness and adoption of the guidelines, including interdisciplinary approaches, consumer education to men and women, strategies to assist practitioners to use the guidelines, and public health strategies. 5. Identify gaps in knowledge and recommend research priorities."

    "abstract": "Many e-commerce Web sites offer numerous services, so a product search could return an overwhelming set of options. Without system support, filtering irrelevant products, comparing alternatives, and selecting the best option can be difficult or impossible - especially for users connecting to the Web through a mobile device. Few Web-based recommender systems have been designed for mobile users. A critique-based recommendation methodology aids the acquisition and revision of user preferences in a mobile recommender system. We designed a product recommendation methodology and implemented it in MobyRek, a mobile-phone recommender system that helps users search for travel products. MobyRek supports limited asking and answering of questions and is based mostly on critiques."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are used to accurately and actively provide users with potentially interesting information or services. Collaborative filtering is a widely adopted approach to recommendation, but sparse data and cold-start users are often barriers to providing high quality recommendations. To address such issues, we propose a novel method that works to improve the performance of collaborative filtering recommendations by integrating sparse rating data given by users and sparse social trust network among these same users. This is a model-based method that adopts matrix factorization technique that maps users into low-dimensional latent feature spaces in terms of their trust relationship, and aims to more accurately reflect the users reciprocal influence on the formation of their own opinions and to learn better preferential patterns of users for high-quality recommendations. We use four large-scale datasets to show that the proposed method performs much better, especially for cold start users, than state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for social collaborative filtering based on trust."

    "title": "Explainable Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graph into recommender systems has attracted increasing attention in recent years. By exploring the interlinks within a knowledge graph, the connectivity between users and items can be discovered as paths, which provide rich and complementary information to user-item interactions. Such connectivity not only reveals the semantics of entities and relations, but also helps to comprehend a user\u2019s interest. However, existing efforts have not fully explored this connectivity to infer user preferences, especially in terms of modeling the sequential dependencies within and holistic semantics of a path.In this paper, we contribute a new model named Knowledgeaware Path Recurrent Network (KPRN) to exploit knowledge graph for recommendation. KPRN can generate path representations by composing the semantics of both entities and relations. By leveraging the sequential dependencies within a path, we allow effective reasoning on paths to infer the underlying rationale of a user-item interaction. Furthermore, we design a new weighted pooling operation to discriminate the strengths of different paths in connecting a user with an item, endowing our model with a certain level of explainability. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets about movie and music, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art solutions Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding and Neural Factorization Machine."

In this article, we give an overview to these recent advances on dialogue systems from various perspectives and discuss some possible research directions. In particular, we generally divide existing dialogue systems into task-oriented and nontask- oriented models, then detail how deep learning techniques help them with representative algorithms and finally discuss some appealing research directions that can bring the dialogue system research into a new frontier"

    "title": "Fusing Similarity Models with Markov Chains for Sparse Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Predicting personalized sequential behavior is a key task for recommender systems. In order to predict user actions such as the next product to purchase, movie to watch, or place to visit, it is essential to take into account both long-term user preferences and sequential patterns (i.e., short-term dynamics). Matrix Factorization and Markov Chain methods have emerged as two separate but powerful paradigms for modeling the two respectively. Combining these ideas has led to unified methods that accommodate long-and short-term dynamics simultaneously by modeling pairwise user-item and item-item interactions. In spite of the success of such methods for tackling dense data, they are challenged by sparsity issues, which are prevalent in real-world datasets. In recent years, similarity-based methods have been proposed for (sequentially-unaware) item recommendation with promising results on sparse datasets. In this paper, we propose to fuse such methods with Markov Chains to make personalized sequential recommendations. We evaluate our method, Fossil, on a variety of large, real-world datasets. We show quantitatively that Fossil outperforms alternative algorithms, especially on sparse datasets, and qualitatively that it captures personalized dynamics and is able to make meaningful recommendations."

    "title": "Trust based recommender system for the semantic web",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes the design of a recommender system that uses knowledge stored in the form of ontologies. The interactions amongst the peer agents for generating recommendations are based on the trust network that exists between them. Recommendations about a product given by peer agents are in the form of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets specified using degree of membership, non membership and uncertainty. In literature, the recommender systems use databases to generate recommendations. The presented design uses ontologies, a knowledge representation technique for creating annotated content for Semantic Web. Seeing the potential and popularity of ontologies among researchers, we believe that ontologies will be build and maintained in numerous knowledge domains for the Semantic Web and future applications. The presented recommender system uses temporal ontologies that absorb the effect of changes in the ontologies due to the dynamic nature of domains, in addition to the benefits of ontologies. A case study of tourism recommender system is chosen to generate the recommendations for the selection of destination, travel agents and the flight schedule. A comparison of the generated recommendations with the manual recommendations by peers establishes the validity of the presented recommender system."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel latent factor model to accurately predict response for large scale dyadic data in the presence of features. Our approach is based on a model that predicts response as a multiplicative function of row and column latent factors that are estimated through separate regressions on known row and column features. In fact, our model provides a single unified framework to address both cold and warm start scenarios that are commonplace in practical applications like recommender systems, online advertising, web search, etc. We provide scalable and accurate model fitting methods based on Iterated Conditional Mode and Monte Carlo EM algorithms. We show our model induces a stochastic process on the dyadic space with kernel (covariance) given by a polynomial function of features. Methods that generalize our procedure to estimate factors in an online fashion for dynamic applications are also considered. Our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a novel content recommendation application that arises in the context of Yahoo! Front Page. We report significant improvements over several commonly used methods on all datasets."

    "title": "A Scalable, Accurate Hybrid Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems apply machine learning techniques for filtering unseen information and can predict whether a user would like a given resource. There are three main types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and demographic recommender systems. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by taking into account the taste (in terms of preferences of items) of users, under the assumption that users will be interested in items that users similar to them have rated highly. Content-based filtering recommender systems recommend items based on the textual information of an item, under the assumption that users will like similar items to the ones they liked before. Demographic recommender systems categorize users or items based on their personal attribute and make recommendation based on demographic categorizations. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. In this paper, we propose a unique cascading hybrid recommendation approach by combining the rating, feature, and demographic information about items. We empirically show that our approach outperforms the state of the art recommender system algorithms, and eliminates recorded problems with recommender systems."

    "title": "A Multi-View Deep Learning Approach for Cross Domain User Modeling in Recommendation Systems",
    "abstract": "Recent online services rely heavily on automatic personalization to recommend relevant content to a large number of users. This requires systems to scale promptly to accommodate the stream of new users visiting the online services for the first time. In this work, we propose a content-based recommendation system to address both the recommendation quality and the system scalability. We propose to use a rich feature set to represent users, according to their web browsing history and search queries. We use a Deep Learning approach to map users and items to a latent space where the similarity between users and their preferred items is maximized. We extend the model to jointly learn from features of items from different domains and user features by introducing a multi-view Deep Learning model. We show how to make this rich-feature based user representation scalable by reducing the dimension of the inputs and the amount of training data. The rich user feature representation allows the model to learn relevant user behavior patterns and give useful recommendations for users who do not have any interaction with the service, given that they have adequate search and browsing history. The combination of different domains into a single model for learning helps improve the recommendation quality across all the domains, as well as having a more compact and a semantically richer user latent feature vector. We experiment with our approach on three real-world recommendation systems acquired from different sources of Microsoft products: Windows Apps recommendation, News recommendation, and Movie/TV recommendation. Results indicate that our approach is significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms (up to 49% enhancement on existing users and 115% enhancement on new users). In addition, experiments on a publicly open data set also indicate the superiority of our method in comparison with transitional generative topic models, for modeling cross-domain recommender systems. Scalability analysis show that our multi-view DNN model can easily scale to encompass millions of users and billions of item entries. Experimental results also confirm that combining features from all domains produces much better performance than building separate models for each domain."

    "title": "A cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers",
    "abstract": "The GPS technology and new forms of urban geography have changed the paradigm for mobile services. As such, the abundant availability of GPS traces has enabled new ways of doing taxi business. Indeed, recent efforts have been made on developing mobile recommender systems for taxi drivers using Taxi GPS traces. These systems can recommend a sequence of pick-up points for the purpose of maximizing the probability of identifying a customer with the shortest driving distance. However, in the real world, the income of taxi drivers is strongly correlated with the effective driving hours. In other words, it is more critical for taxi drivers to know the actual driving routes to minimize the driving time before finding a customer. To this end, in this paper, we propose to develop a cost-effective recommender system for taxi drivers. The design goal is to maximize their profits when following the recommended routes for finding passengers. Specifically, we first design a net profit objective function for evaluating the potential profits of the driving routes. Then, we develop a graph representation of road networks by mining the historical taxi GPS traces and provide a Brute-Force strategy to generate optimal driving route for recommendation. However, a critical challenge along this line is the high computational cost of the graph based approach. Therefore, we develop a novel recursion strategy based on the special form of the net profit function for searching optimal candidate routes efficiently. Particularly, instead of recommending a sequence of pick-up points and letting the driver decide how to get to those points, our recommender system is capable of providing an entire driving route, and the drivers are able to find a customer for the largest potential profit by following the recommendations. This makes our recommender system more practical and profitable than other existing recommender systems. Finally, we carry out extensive experiments on a real-world data set collected from the San Francisco Bay area and the experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed recommender system."

We are very happy to welcome you to the Third ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (ACM RecSys 2009) in New York. In the last few years, ACM RecSys has continuously grown and meanwhile certainly can be understood as the scientific core event in the area of recommender systems, bringing together persons from academic research, industry research as well as from applications. While recommender systems has close relations to many neighboring fields such as machine learning, information retrieval, databases, human computer interaction, e-commerce, semantic web and many others and many of the best conferences in these areas have their dedicated sessions on recommender systems, ACM RecSys is the conference where all of them finally meet. With 187 submissions this year's ACM RecSys has continued to grow at a fast rate of over 50%. Authors from 35 different countries from all over the world submitted their papers. After the program committee consisting of 78 researchers finished a thorough scientific review process in two rounds writing almost 700 reviews, less than 19% of the long submissions have been accepted, the overall acceptance rate for long and short papers is less than 40%. Besides a deepened interest in algorithms for recommender systems, this year tags and social networks, privacy and security and trust attracted the most attention by authors. Moreover, the program of ACM RecSys 2009 includes two keynotes, one from a more academic perspective and another one from a more industrial perspective, a panel session about the recently concluded Netflix challenge, three tutorials and three workshops as well as a doctoral symposium."

In the mobile Internet however, recommendations typically involve \"physical\" entities (e.g., restaurants), requiring additional user effort for fulfillment. Thus, in addition to the inherent requirements of high scalability and low latency, we must also take into account a \"convenience\" metric in making recommendations. In this paper, we propose an enhanced collaborative filtering solution that uses location as a key criterion for generating recommendations. We frame the discussion in the context of our \"restaurant recommender\" system, and describe preliminary results that indicate the utility of such an approach. We conclude with a look at open issues in this space, and motivate a future discussion on the business impact and implications of mining the data in such systems"

In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users\u2019 clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area."

    "title": "Recommendations with Negative Feedback via Pairwise Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a crucial role in mitigating the problem of information overload by suggesting users' personalized items or services. The vast majority of traditional recommender systems consider the recommendation procedure as a static process and make recommendations following a fixed strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system with the capability of continuously improving its strategies during the interactions with users. We model the sequential interactions between users and a recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items from users' feedback. Users' feedback can be positive and negative and both types of feedback have great potentials to boost recommendations. However, the number of negative feedback is much larger than that of positive one; thus incorporating them simultaneously is challenging since positive feedback could be buried by negative one. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to incorporate them into the proposed deep recommender system (DEERS) framework. The experimental results based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments have been conducted to understand the importance of both positive and negative feedback in recommendations."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations\u2019 investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research."

The annual RecSys conference is the premier international forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their challenges, research results, and experiences in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys 2014 features keynote talks, research paper presentations, industry sessions, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, demonstrations, a doctoral symposium, and the RecSys Challenge. The success of a conference largely depends on the quality of the submitted works. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the authors for submitting their original research to Recsys 2014. The RecSys conference has seen remarkable growth since its inception as Recommenders 06 Summer School on the Present and Future of Recommender Systems. It has evolved into a full-fledged, top research conference since 2007, underscoring the increasing role and significant challenges related to recommender systems. This year we received a record number of 234 submissions and accepted 35 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 23%) and 20 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 24%). The RecSys conference is driven by real-world challenges. The key topics covered in this year's research program include ranking and top-n recommendations (7.5% of papers), matrix factorization (5.6%), cold start (5.6%), implicit feedback (4.3%), context awareness (3.6%), metrics and evaluation (3.5%), novel applications (2.9%), and more. The quality of a conference program also depends on the competence and hard work of its devoted volunteers. To select the 55 accepted papers out of the initial 234 submissions, this year, we implemented a two-tier review process, where each paper received detailed reviews from three program committee members, followed by a meta-review by a senior program committee member. Our entire committee involved 20 senior and 102 regular Program Committee members. We are extremely grateful to all the PC members for volunteering their time to generate more than 900 detailed and insightful reviews and discussions. In addition to the technical paper program, the program provides a diverse array of exciting venues for our attendees to interact with top experts from academia and industry on topics related to recommender systems. We are very fortunate to have three world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge challenges and directions in the field. We also feature an industry program capitalizing on being located in Silicon Valley's backyard. The invited industry speakers include renowned executives from top Silicon Valley companies, and representatives of new age companies using Recommender Systems in unique and disruptive ways. In addition, this year's program will host an industry panel discussing the topic of using smart systems monitoring and guiding our socio-digital experience. Our poster and demonstration event showcases numerous posters and nine live system demonstrations. Before and after the main conference, four tutorials and nine workshops will be held, including the RecSys Challenge. In addition, nine students were selected and invited to participate in the doctoral symposium of the conference."

Recommender systems have a large number of applications in many fields, including economic, education, and scientific research. Different empirical studies have shown that the recommender systems are more effective and reliable than the keyword-based search engines for extracting useful knowledge from massive amounts of data. The problem of recommending similar scientific articles in scientific community is called scientific paper recommendation. Scientific paper recommendation aims to recommend new articles or classical articles that match researchers' interests. It has become an attractive area of study since the number of scholarly papers increases exponentially. In this paper, we first introduce the importance and advantages of the paper recommender systems. Second, we review the recommendation algorithms and methods, such as Content-based, collaborative filtering, graph-based, and hybrid methods. Then, we introduce the evaluation methods of different recommender systems. Finally, we summarize the open issues in the paper recommender systems, including cold start, sparsity, scalability, privacy, serendipity, and unified scholarly data standards.

Academic research largely focuses on the value of recommenders for consumers, e.g., in terms of reduced information overload. To what extent and in which ways recommender systems create business value is, however, much less clear, and the literature on the topic is scattered. In this research commentary, we review existing publications on field tests of recommender systems and report which business-related performance measures were used in such real-world deployments. We summarize common challenges of measuring the business value in practice and critically discuss the value of algorithmic improvements and offline experiments as commonly done in academic environments. Overall, our review indicates that various open questions remain both regarding the realistic quantification of the business effects of recommenders and the performance assessment of recommendation algorithms in academia."

    "title": "Avoiding monotony",
    "abstract": "The primary premise upon which top-N recommender systems operate is that similar users are likely to have similar tastes with regard to their product choices. For this reason, recommender algorithms depend deeply on similarity metrics to build the recommendation lists for end-users.However, it has been noted that the products offered on recommendation lists are often too similar to each other and attention has been paid towards the goal of improving diversity to avoid monotonous recommendations.Noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we model the competing goals of maximizing the diversity of the retrieved list while maintaining adequate similarity to the user query as a binary optimization problem. We explore a solution strategy to this optimization problem by relaxing it to a trust-region problem.This leads to a parameterized eigenvalue problem whose solution is finally quantized to the required binary solution. We apply this approach to the top-N prediction problem, evaluate the system performance on the Movielens dataset and compare it with a standard item-based top-N algorithm. A new evaluation metric ItemNovelty is proposed in this work. Improvements on both diversity and accuracy are obtained compared to the benchmark algorithm."

The popular core techniques of such systems are collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and combinations of these. In this paper, we discuss hybrid approaches, using collaborative and also content data to address cold-start - that is, giving recommendations to novel users who have no preference on any items, or recommending items that no user of the community has seen yet. While there have been lots of studies on solving the item-side problems, solution for user-side problems has not been seen public. So we develop a hybrid model based on the analysis of two probabilistic aspect models using pure collaborative filtering to combine with users' information. The experiments with MovieLen data indicate substantial and consistent improvements of this model in overcoming the cold-start user-side problem."

    "title": "Leveraging Meta-path based Context for Top- N Recommendation with A Neural Co-Attention Model",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been widely adopted in recommender systems due to its excellence in modeling complex context information. Although existing HIN based recommendation methods have achieved performance improvement to some extent, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation for path or meta-path in the recommendation task. Second, they do not consider the mutual effect between the meta-path and the involved user-item pair in an interaction. To address these issues, we develop a novel deep neural network with the co-attention mechanism for leveraging rich meta-path based context for top-N recommendation. We elaborately design a three-way neural interaction model by explicitly incorporating meta-path based context. To construct the meta-path based context, we propose to use a priority based sampling technique to select high-quality path instances. Our model is able to learn effective representations for users, items and meta-path based context for implementing a powerful interaction function. The co-attention mechanism improves the representations for meta-path based con- text, users and items in a mutual enhancement way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. In particular, the proposed model performs well in the cold-start scenario and has potentially good interpretability for the recommendation results."

    "title": "A Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm Based on User Clustering and Item Clustering",
    "abstract": "Personalized recommendation systems can help people to find interesting things and they are widely used with the development of electronic commerce. Many recommendation systems employ the collaborative filtering technology, which has been proved to be one of the most successful techniques in recommender systems in recent years. With the gradual increase of customers and products in electronic commerce systems, the time consuming nearest neighbor collaborative filtering search of the target customer in the total customer space resulted in the failure of ensuring the real time requirement of recommender system. At the same time, it suffers from its poor quality when the number of the records in the user database increases. Sparsity of source data set is the major reason causing the poor quality. To solve the problems of scalability and sparsity in the collaborative filtering, this paper proposed a personalized recommendation approach joins the user clustering technology and item clustering technology. Users are clustered based on users\u2019 ratings on items, and each users cluster has a cluster center. Based on the similarity between target user and cluster centers, the nearest neighbors of target user can be found and smooth the prediction where necessary. Then, the proposed approach utilizes the item clustering collaborative filtering to produce the recommendations. The recommendation joining user clustering and item clustering collaborative filtering is more scalable and more accurate than the traditional one."

However, the heterogeneous nature of this information makes it difficult for recommender systems to leverage in a unified framework to boost the performance. Recently, the rapid development of representation learning techniques provides an approach to this problem. By translating the various information sources into a unified representation space, it becomes possible to integrate heterogeneous information for informed recommendation."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already popular products. This paper is a first attempt to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. One, some common recommenders lead to a net reduction in average sales diversity. Two, there exists path dependence, and in individual instances the same recommender can either increase or decrease diversity. Three, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome."

WSRec is implemented by Java language and deployed to the real-world environment. To study the prediction performance, a total of 21,197 public Web services are obtained from the Internet and a large-scale real-world experiment is conducted, where more than 1.5 millions test results are collected from 150 service users in different countries on 100 publicly available Web services located all over the world. The comprehensive experimental analysis shows that WSRec achieves better prediction accuracy than other approaches."

    "title": "PocketLens",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems using collaborative filtering are a popular technique for reducing information overload and finding products to purchase. One limitation of current recommenders is that they are not portable. They can only run on large computers connected to the Internet. A second limitation is that they require the user to trust the owner of the recommender with personal preference data. Personal recommenders hold the promise of delivering high quality recommendations on palmtop computers, even when disconnected from the Internet. Further, they can protect the user's privacy by storing personal information locally, or by sharing it in encrypted form. In this article we present the new PocketLens collaborative filtering algorithm along with five peer-to-peer architectures for finding neighbors. We evaluate the architectures and algorithms in a series of offline experiments. These experiments show that Pocketlens can run on connected servers, on usually connected workstations, or on occasionally connected portable devices, and produce recommendations that are as good as the best published algorithms to date."

    "abstract": "Contextual factors can greatly influence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction."

    "title": "Semantic Path based Personalized Recommendation on Weighted Heterogeneous Information Networks",
    "abstract": "Recently heterogeneous information network (HIN) analysis has attracted a lot of attention, and many data mining tasks have been exploited on HIN. As an important data mining task, recommender system includes a lot of object types (e.g., users, movies, actors, and interest groups in movie recommendation) and the rich relations among object types, which naturally constitute a HIN. The comprehensive information integration and rich semantic information of HIN make it promising to generate better recommendations. However, conventional HINs do not consider the attribute values on links, and the widely used meta path in HIN may fail to accurately capture semantic relations among objects, due to the existence of rating scores (usually ranging from 1 to 5) between users and items in recommender system. In this paper, we are the first to propose the weighted HIN and weighted meta path concepts to subtly depict the path semantics through distinguishing different link attribute values. Furthermore, we propose a semantic path based personalized recommendation method SemRec to predict the rating scores of users on items. Through setting meta paths, SemRec not only flexibly integrates heterogeneous information but also obtains prioritized and personalized weights representing user preferences on paths. Experiments on two real datasets illustrate that SemRec achieves better recommendation performance through flexibly integrating information with the help of weighted meta paths."

    "abstract": "During the last decades huge amounts of data have been collected in clinical databases representing patients' health states (e.g., as laboratory results, treatment plans, medical reports). Hence, digital information available for patient-oriented decision making has increased drastically but is often scattered across different sites. As as solution, personal health record systems (PHRS) are meant to centralize an individual's health data and to allow access for the owner as well as for authorized health professionals. Yet, expert-oriented language, complex interrelations of medical facts and information overload in general pose major obstacles for patients to understand their own record and to draw adequate conclusions. In this context, recommender systems may supply patients with additional laymen-friendly information helping to better comprehend their health status as represented by their record. However, such systems must be adapted to cope with the specific requirements in the health domain in order to deliver highly relevant information for patients. They are referred to as health recommender systems (HRS). In this article we give an introduction to health recommender systems and explain why they are a useful enhancement to PHR solutions. Basic concepts and scenarios are discussed and a first implementation is presented. In addition, we outline an evaluation approach for such a system, which is supported by medical experts. The construction of a test collection for case-related recommendations is described. Finally, challenges and open issues are discussed."

    "abstract": "Service recommender systems have been shown as valuable tools for providing appropriate recommendations to users. In the last decade, the amount of customers, services and online information has grown rapidly, yielding the big data analysis problem for service recommender systems. Consequently, traditional service recommender systems often suffer from scalability and inefficiency problems when processing or analysing such large-scale data. Moreover, most of existing service recommender systems present the same ratings and rankings of services to different users without considering diverse users' preferences, and therefore fails to meet users' personalized requirements. In this paper, we propose a Keyword-Aware Service Recommendation method, named KASR, to address the above challenges. It aims at presenting a personalized service recommendation list and recommending the most appropriate services to the users effectively. Specifically, keywords are used to indicate users' preferences, and a user-based Collaborative Filtering algorithm is adopted to generate appropriate recommendations. To improve its scalability and efficiency in big data environment, KASR is implemented on Hadoop, a widely-adopted distributed computing platform using the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data sets, and results demonstrate that KASR significantly improves the accuracy and scalability of service recommender systems over existing approaches."

While most existing recommender systems rely either on a content-based approach or a collaborative approach to make recommendations, there is potential to improve recommendation quality by using a combination of both approaches (a hybrid approach). In this paper, we report how we tested the idea of using a graph-based recommender system that naturally combines the content-based and collaborative approaches. Due to the similarity between our problem and a concept retrieval task, a Hopfield net algorithm was used to exploit high-degree book-book, user-user and book-user associations. Sample hold-out testing and preliminary subject testing were conducted to evaluate the system, by which it was found that the system gained improvement with respect to both precision and recall by combining content-based and collaborative approaches. However, no significant improvement was observed by exploiting high-degree associations."

To tackle data sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems, researchers propose knowledge graphs (KGs) based recommendations by leveraging valuable external knowledge as auxiliary information. However, most of these works ignore the variety of data types (e.g., texts and images) in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). In this paper, we propose Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Attention Network (MKGAT) to better enhance recommender systems by leveraging multi-modal knowledge. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal graph attention technique to conduct information propagation over MMKGs, and then use the resulting aggregated embedding representation for recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates multi-modal knowledge graph into recommender systems. We conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets from different domains, results of which demonstrate that our model MKGAT can successfully employ MMKGs to improve the quality of recommendation system."

Recommendations are based on two of the core elements of social media - people and tags. Relationship information among people, tags, and items, is collected and aggregated across different sources within the enterprise. Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest."

The combination of mobile phones and recommender systems can change the way one deals with such abundance. Mobile phones with positioning technology are now widely available, making it easy for people to broadcast their whereabouts, recommender systems can now identify patterns in people's movements in order to, for example, recommend events. To do so, the system relies on having mobile users who share their attendance at a large number of social events: cold-start users, who have no location history, cannot receive recommendations. We set out to address the mobile cold-start problem by answering the following research question: how can social events be recommended to a cold-start user based only on his home location? To answer this question, we carry out a study of the relationship between preferences for social events and geography, the first of its kind in a large metropolitan area. We sample location estimations of one million mobile phone users in Greater Boston, combine the sample with social events in the same area, and infer the social events attended by 2,519 residents. Upon this data, we test a variety of algorithms for recommending social events. We find that the most effective algorithm recommends events that are popular among residents of an area. The least effective, instead, recommends events that are geographically close to the area. This last result has interesting implications for location-based services that emphasize recommending nearby events."

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have led to substantial progress in various application fields of AI, and in recent years a number of proposals were made to improve recommender systems with artificial neural networks. For the problem of making session-based recommendations, i.e., for recommending the next item in an anonymous session, Hidasi et al.~recently investigated the application of recurrent neural networks with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU4REC). Assessing the true effectiveness of such novel approaches based only on what is reported in the literature is however difficult when no standard evaluation protocols are applied and when the strength of the baselines used in the performance comparison is not clear. In this work we show based on a comprehensive empirical evaluation that a heuristics-based nearest neighbor (kNN) scheme for sessions outperforms GRU4REC in the large majority of the tested configurations and datasets. Neighborhood sampling and efficient in-memory data structures ensure the scalability of the kNN method. The best results in the end were often achieved when we combine the kNN approach with GRU4REC, which shows that RNNs can leverage sequential signals in the data that cannot be detected by the co-occurrence-based kNN method."

Our findings show that participants were able to quickly build sound mental models of the recommender system's reasoning, and that participants who most improved their mental models during the study were significantly more likely to make the recommender operate to their satisfaction. These results suggest that by helping end users understand a system's reasoning, intelligent agents may elicit more and better feedback, thus more closely aligning their output with each user's intentions."

However, because of the drawbacks of collaborative-based methods such as sparsity, cold start, etc., more attention has been drawn to hybrid methods that consider both the rating and content information. Most of the previous works in this area cannot learn a good representation from content for recommendation task or consider only text modality of the content, thus their methods are very limited in current multimedia scenario. This paper proposes a Bayesian generative model called collaborative variational autoencoder (CVAE) that considers both rating and content for recommendation in multimedia scenario. The model learns deep latent representations from content data in an unsupervised manner and also learns implicit relationships between items and users from both content and rating. Unlike previous works with denoising criteria, the proposed CVAE learns a latent distribution for content in latent space instead of observation space through an inference network and can be easily extended to other multimedia modalities other than text. Experiments show that CVAE is able to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art recommendation methods with more robust performance."

We explore the rich evidence source of aspects in user reviews to improve top-N recommendation. By extracting aspects (i.e., the specific properties of items) from textual reviews, we enrich the user--item binary relation to a user--item--aspect ternary relation. We model the ternary relation as a heterogeneous tripartite graph, casting the recommendation task as one of vertex ranking. We devise a generic algorithm for ranking on tripartite graphs -- TriRank -- and specialize it for personalized recommendation. Experiments on two public review datasets show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Most importantly, TriRank endows the recommender system with a higher degree of explainability and transparency by modeling aspects in reviews. It allows users to interact with the system through their aspect preferences, assisting users in making informed decisions."

Methods that rely on user profiles -- such as matrix factorization -- perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline."

However, MTL models often suffer from performance degeneration with negative transfer due to the complex and competing task correlation in real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through extensive experiments across SOTA MTL models, we have observed an interesting seesaw phenomenon that performance of one task is often improved by hurting the performance of some other tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) model with a novel sharing structure design. PLE separates shared components and task-specific components explicitly and adopts a progressive routing mechanism to extract and separate deeper semantic knowledge gradually, improving efficiency of joint representation learning and information routing across tasks in a general setup. We apply PLE to both complicatedly correlated and normally correlated tasks, ranging from two-task cases to multi-task cases on a real-world Tencent video recommendation dataset with 1 billion samples, and results show that PLE outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models significantly under different task correlations and task-group size. Furthermore, online evaluation of PLE on a large-scale content recommendation platform at Tencent manifests 2.23% increase in view-count and 1.84% increase in watch time compared to SOTA MTL models, which is a significant improvement and demonstrates the effectiveness of PLE. Finally, extensive offline experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that PLE can be applied to a variety of scenarios besides recommendations to eliminate the seesaw phenomenon. PLE now has been deployed to the online video recommender system in Tencent successfully."

This is because tacit knowledge is inherently elusive, and in order to capture, store, and disseminate it, it is argued that it first has to be made explicit. However, such a process is difficult, and often fails due to three reasons: (1) we are not necessarily aware of our tacit knowledge, (2) on a personal level, we do not need to make it explicit in order to use it, and (3) we may not want to give up a valuable competitive advantage. During an empirical study of recommender system usage, it was noticed how such technology could be used to circumvent these problems, and make tacit knowledge, in the form of our professional interests, available to the organization as a whole. Using Polanyi's theories, it will be shown how intranet documents can be used to make tacit knowledge tangible without becoming explicit, suggesting that tacitly expressed entities are not necessarily beyond the reach of information technology."

    "abstract": "A personalized conversational sales agent could have much commercial potential. E-commerce companies such as Amazon, eBay, JD, Alibaba etc. are piloting such kind of agents with their users. However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users' long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function. In particular, we propose to represent a user conversation history as a semi-structured user query with facet-value pairs. This query is generated and updated by belief tracker that analyzes natural language utterances of user at each step. We propose a set of machine actions tailored for recommendation agents and train a deep policy network to decide which action (i.e. asking for the value of a facet or making a recommendation) the agent should take at each step. We train a personalized recommendation model that uses both the user's past ratings and user query collected in the current conversational session when making rating predictions and generating recommendations. Such a conversational system often tries to collect user preferences by asking questions. Once enough user preference is collected, it makes personalized recommendations to the user. We perform both simulation experiments and real online user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

An ordered collection of past items the user has interacted with in a session (or sequence) are embedded into a 2-dimensional latent matrix, and treated as an image. The convolution and pooling operations are then applied to the mapped item embeddings. In this paper, we first examine the typical session-based CNN recommender and show that both the generative model and network architecture are suboptimal when modeling long-range dependencies in the item sequence. To address the issues, we introduce a simple, but very effective generative model that is capable of learning high-level representation from both short- and long-range item dependencies. The network architecture of the proposed model is formed of a stack of holed convolutional layers, which can efficiently increase the receptive fields without relying on the pooling operation. Another contribution is the effective use of residual block structure in recommender systems, which can ease the optimization for much deeper networks. The proposed generative model attains state-of-the-art accuracy with less training time in the next item recommendation task. It accordingly can be used as a powerful recommendation baseline to beat in future, especially when there are long sequences of user feedback."

Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations.\r\n\r\nSemantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain.\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates the synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured."

    "title": "A Scalable Collaborative Filtering Framework Based on Co-Clustering",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems have become extremely popular due to the increase in Web-based activities such as e-commerce and online content distribution. Current collaborative filtering (CF) techniques such as correlation and SVD based methods provide good accuracy, but are computationally expensive and can be deployed only in static off-line settings. However, a number of practical scenarios require dynamic real-time collaborative filtering that can allow new users, items and ratings to enter the system at a rapid rate. In this paper, we consider a novel CF approach based on a proposed weighted co-clustering algorithm (Banerjee et al., 2004) that involves simultaneous clustering of users and items. We design incremental and parallel versions of the co-clustering algorithm and use it to build an efficient real-time CF framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach provides an accuracy comparable to that of the correlation and matrix factorization based approaches at a much lower computational cost."

    "title": "Mobile app recommendations with security and privacy awareness",
    "abstract": "With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices, the number of mobile Apps available has exploded over the past few years. To facilitate the choice of mobile Apps, existing mobile App recommender systems typically recommend popular mobile Apps to mobile users. However, mobile Apps are highly varied and often poorly understood, particularly for their activities and functions related to privacy and security. Therefore, more and more mobile users are reluctant to adopt mobile Apps due to the risk of privacy invasion and other security concerns. To fill this crucial void, in this paper, we propose to develop a mobile App recommender system with privacy and security awareness. The design goal is to equip the recommender system with the functionality which allows to automatically detect and evaluate the security risk of mobile Apps. Then, the recommender system can provide App recommendations by considering both the Apps' popularity and the users' security preferences. Specifically, a mobile App can lead to security risk because insecure data access permissions have been implemented in this App. Therefore, we first develop the techniques to automatically detect the potential security risk for each mobile App by exploiting the requested permissions. Then, we propose a flexible approach based on modern portfolio theory for recommending Apps by striking a balance between the Apps' popularity and the users' security concerns, and build an App hash tree to efficiently recommend Apps. Finally, we evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Google Play. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach."

    "title": "Visually-Aware Fashion Recommendation and Design with Generative Image Models",
    "abstract": "Building effective recommender systems for domains like fashion is challenging due to the high level of subjectivity and the semantic complexity of the features involved (i.e., fashion styles). Recent work has shown that approaches to 'visual' recommendation (e.g. clothing, art, etc.) can be made more accurate by incorporating visual signals directly into the recommendation objective, using 'off-the-shelf' feature representations derived from deep networks. Here, we seek to extend this contribution by showing that recommendation performance can be significantly improved by learning 'fashion aware' image representations directly, i.e., by training the image representation (from the pixel level) and the recommender system jointly; this contribution is related to recent work using Siamese CNNs, though we are able to show improvements over state-of-the-art recommendation techniques such as BPR and variants that make use of pretrained visual features. Furthermore, we show that our model can be used generatively, i.e., given a user and a product category, we can generate new images (i.e., clothing items) that are most consistent with their personal taste. This represents a first step towards building systems that go beyond recommending existing items from a product corpus, but which can be used to suggest styles and aid the design of new products."

    "title": "Rethinking the recommender research ecosystem",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems research is being slowed by the difficulty of replicating and comparing research results. Published research uses various experimental methodologies and metrics that are difficult to compare. It also often fails to sufficiently document the details of proposed algorithms or the evaluations employed. Researchers waste time reimplementing well-known algorithms, and the new implementations may miss key details from the original algorithm or its subsequent refinements. When proposing new algorithms, researchers should compare them against finely-tuned implementations of the leading prior algorithms using state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies. With few exceptions, published algorithmic improvements in our field should be accompanied by working code in a standard framework, including test harnesses to reproduce the described results. To that end, we present the design and freely distributable source code of LensKit, a flexible platform for reproducible recommender systems research. LensKit provides carefully tuned implementations of the leading collaborative filtering algorithms, APIs for common recommender system use cases, and an evaluation framework for performing reproducible offline evaluations of algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of LensKit by replicating and extending a set of prior comparative studies of recommender algorithms --- showing limitations in some of the original results --- and by investigating a question recently raised by a leader in the recommender systems community on problems with error-based prediction evaluation."

    "title": "Session-Based Social Recommendation via Dynamic Graph Attention Networks",
    "abstract": "Online communities such as Facebook and Twitter are enormously popular and have become an essential part of the daily life of many of their users. Through these platforms, users can discover and create information that others will then consume. In that context, recommending relevant information to users becomes critical for viability. However, recommendation in online communities is a challenging problem: 1) users' interests are dynamic, and 2) users are influenced by their friends. Moreover, the influencers may be context-dependent. That is, different friends may be relied upon for different topics. Modeling both signals is therefore essential for recommendations. We propose a recommender system for online communities based on a dynamic-graph-attention neural network. We model dynamic user behaviors with a recurrent neural network, and context-dependent social influence with a graph-attention neural network, which dynamically infers the influencers based on users' current interests. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale data. Experimental results on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over several competitive baselines including state-of-the-art models."

In an offline setting, recommending most popular stories is the best strategy, while in a live environment this strategy is the poorest. For online setting, context-tree recommender systems which profile the users in real-time improve the click-through rate by up to 35%. The visit length also increases by a factor of 2.5. Our experience holds important lessons for the evaluation of recommender systems with offline data as well as for the use of the click-through rate as a performance indicator."

    "title": "A^3NCF: An Adaptive Aspect Attention Model for Rating Prediction",
    "abstract": "Current recommender systems consider the various aspects of items for making accurate recommendations. Different users place different importance to these aspects which can be thought of as a preference/attention weight vector. Most existing recommender systems assume that for an individual, this vector is the same for all items. However, this assumption is often invalid, especially when considering a user's interactions with items of diverse characteristics. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we develop a novel aspect-aware recommender model named A$^3$NCF, which can capture the varying aspect attentions that a user pays to different items. Specifically, we design a new topic model to extract user preferences and item characteristics from review texts. They are then used to 1) guide the representation learning of users and items, and 2) capture a user's special attention on each aspect of the targeted item with an attention network. Through extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art review-aware recommender systems in the rating prediction task."

In order to support learning, recommender systems for TEL need to consider specific requirements, which differ from the requirements for recommender systems in other domains like e-commerce. Consequently, these particular requirements motivate the incorporation of specific goals and methods in the evaluation process for TEL recommender systems. In this article, the diverse evaluation methods that have been applied to evaluate TEL recommender systems are investigated. A total of 235 articles are selected from major conferences, workshops, journals, and books where relevant work have been published between 2000 and 2014. These articles are quantitatively analysed and classified according to the following criteria: type of evaluation methodology, subject of evaluation, and effects measured by the evaluation. Results from the survey suggest that there is a growing awareness in the research community of the necessity for more elaborate evaluations. At the same time, there is still substantial potential for further improvements. This survey highlights trends and discusses strengths and shortcomings of the evaluation of TEL recommender systems thus far, thereby aiming to stimulate researchers to contemplate novel evaluation approaches."

    "abstract": "We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for deciding which system functions should be automated and to what extent. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design."

    "title": "Neural Attentional Rating Regression with Review-level Explanations",
    "abstract": "Reviews information is dominant for users to make online purchasing decisions in e-commerces. However, the usefulness of reviews is varied. We argue that less-useful reviews hurt model's performance, and are also less meaningful for user's reference. While some existing models utilize reviews for improving the performance of recommender systems, few of them consider the usefulness of reviews for recommendation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to explore the usefulness of reviews, and propose a Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations (NARRE) for recommendation. Specifically, NARRE can not only predict precise ratings, but also learn the usefulness of each review simultaneously. Therefore, the highly-useful reviews are obtained which provide review-level explanations to help users make better and faster decisions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of Amazon and Yelp on different domains show that the proposed NARRE model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches, including PMF, NMF, SVD++, HFT, and DeepCoNN in terms of rating prediction, by the proposed attention model that takes review usefulness into consideration. Furthermore, the selected reviews are shown to be effective when taking existing review-usefulness ratings in the system as ground truth. Besides, crowd-sourcing based evaluations reveal that in most cases, NARRE achieves equal or even better performances than system's usefulness rating method in selecting reviews. And it is flexible to offer great help on the dominant cases in real e-commerce scenarios when the ratings on review-usefulness are not available in the system."

    "title": "Scalable Coordinate Descent Approaches to Parallel Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Matrix factorization, when the matrix has missing values, has become one of the leading techniques for recommender systems. To handle web-scale datasets with millions of users and billions of ratings, scalability becomes an important issue. Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are two popular approaches to compute matrix factorization. There has been a recent flurry of activity to parallelize these algorithms. However, due to the cubic time complexity in the target rank, ALS is not scalable to large-scale datasets. On the other hand, SGD conducts efficient updates but usually suffers from slow convergence that is sensitive to the parameters. Coordinate descent, a classical optimization approach, has been used for many other large-scale problems, but its application to matrix factorization for recommender systems has not been explored thoroughly. In this paper, we show that coordinate descent based methods have a more efficient update rule compared to ALS, and are faster and have more stable convergence than SGD. We study different update sequences and propose the CCD++ algorithm, which updatesrank-one factors one by one. In addition, CCD++ can be easily parallelized on both multi-core and distributed systems. We empirically show that CCD++ is much faster than ALS and SGD in both settings. As an example, on a synthetic dataset with 2 billion ratings, CCD++ is 4 times faster than both SGD and ALS using a distributed system with 20 machines."

    "title": "Enhancing Collaborative Filtering by User Interest Expansion via Personalized Ranking",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems suggest a few items from many possible choices to the users by understanding their past behaviors. In these systems, the user behaviors are influenced by the hidden interests of the users. Learning to leverage the information about user interests is often critical for making better recommendations. However, existing collaborative-filtering-based recommender systems are usually focused on exploiting the information about the user's interaction with the systems; the information about latent user interests is largely underexplored. To that end, inspired by the topic models, in this paper, we propose a novel collaborative-filtering-based recommender system by user interest expansion via personalized ranking, named iExpand. The goal is to build an item-oriented model-based collaborative-filtering framework. The iExpand method introduces a three-layer, user-interests-item, representation scheme, which leads to more accurate ranking recommendation results with less computation cost and helps the understanding of the interactions among users, items, and user interests. Moreover, iExpand strategically deals with many issues that exist in traditional collaborative-filtering approaches, such as the overspecialization problem and the cold-start problem. Finally, we evaluate iExpand on three benchmark data sets, and experimental results show that iExpand can lead to better ranking performance than state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin."

Scholars have worried that proliferation of personalization technologies will degrade public opinion by isolating people from challenging perspectives. Informed by selective exposure research, this study examines personalized news recommender system designs using a communication mediation model. Recommender system design choices examined include computer-generated personalized recommendations, user-customized recommendations, and full or limited news information environments based on recommendations. Results from an online mock election experiment with Ohio adult Internet users indicate increased selective exposure when using personalized news systems. However, portals recommending news based on explicit user customization result in significantly higher counterattitudinal news exposure. Expected positive effects on elaboration and indirect effects on knowledge through elaboration are found only in personalized news recommender systems that display only recommended headlines. Lastly, personalized news recommender system use has a negative direct effect on knowledge."

In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of Web2.0 recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these social tags directly from MP3 files. Using a set of boosted classifiers, we map audio features onto social tags collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the cold-start problem common in such systems. Autotags can also be used to smooth the tag space from which similarities and recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system."

In this work, we contribute a new solution named NMTR (short for Neural Multi-Task Recommendation) for learning recommender systems from user multi-behavior data. In particular, our model accounts for the cascading relationship among different types of behaviors (e.g., a user must click on a product before purchasing it). We perform a joint optimization based on the multi-task learning framework, where the optimization on a behavior is treated as a task. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that NMTR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems that are designed to learn from both single-behavior data and multi-behavior data."

    "abstract": "Recently, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Foursquare, Facebook, and Brightkite, etc., have attracted millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins. The available check-in information makes it possible to mine users\u2019 preference on locations and to provide favorite recommendations. Personalized Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in LBSNs since it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers to provide personalized services. To solve this task, matrix factorization is a promising tool due to its success in recommender systems. However, previously proposed matrix factorization (MF) methods do not explore geographical influence, e.g., multi-center check-in property, which yields suboptimal solutions for the recommendation. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fuse MF with geographical and social influence for POI recommendation in LBSNs. We first capture the geographical influence via modeling the probability of a user\u2019s check-in on a location as a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM). Next, we include social information and fuse the geographical influence into a generalized matrix factorization framework. Our solution to POI recommendation is efficient and scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally, we conduct thorough experiments on a large-scale real-world LBSNs dataset and demonstrate that the fused matrix factorization framework with MGM utilizes the distance information sufficiently and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly."

This thriving subfield of machine learning became popular in the late 1990s with the spread of online services that use recommender systems, such as Amazon, Yahoo! Music, and Netflix. CF approaches are usually designed to work on very large data sets. Therefore the scalability of the methods is crucial. In this work, we propose various scalable solutions that are validated against the Netflix Prize data set, currently the largest publicly available collection. First, we propose various matrix factorization (MF) based techniques. Second, a neighbor correction method for MF is outlined, which alloys the global perspective of MF and the localized property of neighbor based approaches efficiently. In the experimentation section, we first report on some implementation issues, and we suggest on how parameter optimization can be performed efficiently for MFs. We then show that the proposed scalable approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. Finally, we report on some experiments performed on MovieLens and Jester data sets."

The price of the better accuracy is paid by the increased running time: the running time of the original version of ALS is proportional to K3. Yet, the running time of model building can be important in recommendation systems; if the model cannot keep up with the changing item portfolio and/or user profile, the prediction accuracy can be degraded."

These genes have been described in 85 eukaryote (including vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, and plants) and 20 prokaryote species. Of 74 gene families so far described, 14 families exist in all mammals examined to date. These 14 families comprise 26 mammalian subfamilies, of which 20 and 15 have been mapped in the human genome and the mouse genome, respectively. Each subfamily usually represents a cluster of tightly linked genes widely scattered throughout the genome, but there are exceptions. Interestingly, the CYP51 family has been found in mammals, filamentous fungi and yeast, and plants - attesting to the fact that this P450 gene family is very ancient. One functional CYP51 gene and two processed pseudogenes, which are the first examples of intronless pseudogenes within the P450 superfamily, have been mapped to three different human chromosomes This revision supersedes the four previous updates in which a nomenclature system, based on divergent evolution of the superfamily, has been described. For the gene, we recommend that the italicized root symbol 'CYP' for human ('Cyp' for mouse and Drosophila), representing 'cytochrome P450' be followed by an Arabic number denoting the family, a letter designating the subfamily (when two or more exist), and an Arabic numeral representing the individual gene within the subfamily. A hyphen is no longer recommended in mouse gene nomenclature. 'P' ('ps' in mouse and Drosophila) after the gene number denotes a pseudogene; 'X' after the gene number means its use has been discontinued. If a gene is the sole member of a family, the subfamily letter and gene number would be helpful but need not be included. The human nomenclature system should be used for all species other than mouse and Drosophila. The cDNAs, mRNAs and enzymes in all species (including mouse) should include all capital letters, and without italics or hyphens. This nomenclature system is similar to that proposed in our previous updates"

    "abstract": "Acoustic-based music recommender systems have received increasing interest in recent years. Due to the semantic gap between low level acoustic features and high level music concepts, many researchers have explored collaborative filtering techniques in music recommender systems. Traditional collaborative filtering music recommendation methods only focus on user rating information. However, there are various kinds of social media information, including different types of objects and relations among these objects, in music social communities such as Last.fm and Pandora. This information is valuable for music recommendation. However, there are two challenges to exploit this rich social media information: (a) There are many different types of objects and relations in music social communities, which makes it difficult to develop a unified framework taking into account all objects and relations. (b) In these communities, some relations are much more sophisticated than pairwise relation, and thus cannot be simply modeled by a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel music recommendation algorithm by using both multiple kinds of social media information and music acoustic-based content. Instead of graph, we use hypergraph to model the various objects and relations, and consider music recommendation as a ranking problem on this hypergraph. While an edge of an ordinary graph connects only two objects, a hyperedge represents a set of objects. In this way, hypergraph can be naturally used to model high-order relations. Experiments on a data set collected from the music social community Last.fm have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) generally and machine learning (ML) specifically demonstrate impressive practical success in many different application domains, e.g. in autonomous driving, speech recognition, or recommender systems. Deep learning approaches, trained on extremely large data sets or using reinforcement learning methods have even exceeded human performance in visual tasks, particularly on playing games such as Atari, or mastering the game of Go. Even in the medical domain there are remarkable results. The central problem of such models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory structures. This calls for systems enabling to make decisions transparent, understandable and explainable. A huge motivation for our approach are rising legal and privacy aspects. The new European General Data Protection Regulation entering into force on May 25th 2018, will make black-box approaches difficult to use in business. This does not imply a ban on automatic learning approaches or an obligation to explain everything all the time, however, there must be a possibility to make the results re-traceable on demand. In this paper we outline some of our research topics in the context of the relatively new area of explainable-AI with a focus on the application in medicine, which is a very special domain. This is due to the fact that medical professionals are working mostly with distributed heterogeneous and complex sources of data. In this paper we concentrate on three sources: images, *omics data and text. We argue that research in explainable-AI would generally help to facilitate the implementation of AI/ML in the medical domain, and specifically help to facilitate transparency and trust."

    "abstract": "Recently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) solutions for recommender systems (RS) are becoming increasingly popular. The insight is that, there exist some intrinsic patterns in the sequence of users' actions, and RNN has been proved to perform excellently when modeling sequential data. In traditional tasks such as language modeling, RNN solutions usually only consider the sequential order of objects without the notion of interval. However, in RS, time intervals between users' actions are of significant importance in capturing the relations of users' actions and the traditional RNN architectures are not good at modeling them. In this paper, we propose a new LSTM variant, i.e. Time-LSTM, to model users' sequential actions. Time-LSTM equips LSTM with time gates to model time intervals. These time gates are specifically designed, so that compared to the traditional RNN solutions, Time-LSTM better captures both of users' short-term and long-term interests, so as to improve the recommendation performance. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the superiority of the recommendation method using Time-LSTM over the traditional methods."

    "abstract": "When a user has watched, say, 70 romance movies and 30 action movies, then it is reasonable to expect the personalized list of recommended movies to be comprised of about 70% romance and 30% action movies as well. This important property is known as calibration, and recently received renewed attention in the context of fairness in machine learning. In the recommended list of items, calibration ensures that the various (past) areas of interest of a user are reflected with their corresponding proportions. Calibration is especially important in light of the fact that recommender systems optimized toward accuracy (e.g., ranking metrics) in the usual offline-setting can easily lead to recommendations where the lesser interests of a user get crowded out by the user's main interests-which we show empirically as well as in thought-experiments. This can be prevented by calibrated recommendations. To this end, we outline metrics for quantifying the degree of calibration, as well as a simple yet effective re-ranking algorithm for post-processing the output of recommender systems."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become a popular and effective means to manage the ever-increasing amount of multimedia content available today and to help users discover interesting new items. Today\u2019s recommender systems suggest items of various media types, including audio, text, visual (images), and videos. In fact, scientific research related to the analysis of multimedia content has made possible effective content-based recommender systems capable of suggesting items based on an analysis of the features extracted from the item itself. The aim of this survey is to present a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of recommender systems that leverage multimedia content, by classifying the reviewed papers with respect to their media type, the techniques employed to extract and represent their content features, and the recommendation algorithm. Moreover, for each media type, we discuss various domains in which multimedia content plays a key role in human decision-making and is therefore considered in the recommendation process. Examples of the identified domains include fashion, tourism, food, media streaming, and e-commerce."

    "title": "Burst of the Filter Bubble?",
    "abstract": "In offering personalized content geared toward users\u2019 individual interests, recommender systems are assumed to reduce news diversity and thus lead to partial information blindness (i.e., filter bubbles). We conducted two exploratory studies to test the effect of both implicit and explicit personalization on the content and source diversity of Google News. Except for small effects of implicit personalization on content diversity, we found no support for the filter-bubble hypothesis. We did, however, find a general bias in that Google News over-represents certain news outlets and under-represents other, highly frequented, news outlets. The results add to a growing body of evidence, which suggests that concerns about algorithmic filter bubbles in the context of online news might be exaggerated."

    "title": "Multi-Interest Network with Dynamic Routing for Recommendation at Tmall",
    "abstract": "Industrial recommender systems have embraced deep learning algorithms for building intelligent systems to make accurate recommendations. At its core, deep learning offers powerful ability for learning representations from data, especially for user and item representations. Existing deep learning-based models usually represent a user by one representation vector, which is usually insufficient to capture diverse interests for large-scale users in practice. In this paper, we approach the learning of user representations from a different view, by representing a user with multiple representation vectors encoding the different aspects of the user's interests. To this end, we propose the Multi-Interest Network with Dynamic routing (MIND) for learning user representations in recommender systems. Specifically, we design a multi-interest extractor layer based on the recently proposed dynamic routing mechanism, which is applicable for modeling and extracting diverse interests from user's behaviors. Furthermore, a technique named label-aware attention is proposed to help the learning process of user representations. Through extensive experiments on several public benchmarks and one large-scale industrial dataset from Tmall, we demonstrate that MIND can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy. Currently, MIND has been deployed for handling major online traffic at the homepage on Mobile Tmall App."

Although several efforts have been made for CRS, two major issues still remain to be solved. First, the conversation data itself lacks of sufficient contextual information for accurately understanding users' preference. Second, there is a semantic gap between natural language expression and item-level user preference."

    "title": "Personalized Recommendation Combining User Interest and Social Circle",
    "abstract": "With the advent and popularity of social network, more and more users like to share their experiences, such as ratings, reviews, and blogs. The new factors of social network like interpersonal influence and interest based on circles of friends bring opportunities and challenges for recommender system (RS) to solve the cold start and sparsity problem of datasets. Some of the social factors have been used in RS, but have not been fully considered. In this paper, three social factors, personal interest, interpersonal interest similarity, and interpersonal influence, fuse into a unified personalized recommendation model based on probabilistic matrix factorization. The factor of personal interest can make the RS recommend items to meet users' individualities, especially for experienced users. Moreover, for cold start users, the interpersonal interest similarity and interpersonal influence can enhance the intrinsic link among features in the latent space. We conduct a series of experiments on three rating datasets: Yelp, MovieLens, and Douban Movie. Experimental results show the proposed approach outperforms the existing RS approaches."

    "abstract": "In Web-based services of dynamic content (such as news articles), recommender systems face the difficulty of timely identifying new items of high-quality and providing recommendations for new users. We propose a feature-based machine learning approach to personalized recommendation that is capable of handling the cold-start issue effectively. We maintain profiles of content of interest, in which temporal characteristics of the content, e.g. popularity and freshness, are updated in real-time manner. We also maintain profiles of users including demographic information and a summary of user activities within Yahoo! properties. Based on all features in user and content profiles, we develop predictive bilinear regression models to provide accurate personalized recommendations of new items for both existing and new users. This approach results in an offline model with light computational overhead compared with other recommender systems that require online re-training. The proposed framework is general and flexible for other personalized tasks. The superior performance of our approach is verified on a large-scale data set collected from the Today-Module on Yahoo! Front Page, with comparison against six competitive approaches."

    "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2017 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2017), held in Como, Italy, from August 27th though 31st. The ACM Recommender Systems conference (RecSys) is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. Recommendation is a particular form of information filtering that exploits past behaviors and user similarities to generate a list of information items that is personally tailored to an enduser's preferences. As RecSys brings together the main international research groups working on recommender systems, along with many of the world's leading e-commerce companies, it has become the most important annual conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender systems research. RecSys 2017, is the eleventh conference in this series. It brings together researchers and practitioners from the academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts. In addition to the main technical track, RecSys 2017 program features keynote and invited talks, tutorials covering state-of-the-art in this domain, a workshop program, an industrial track and a doctoral symposium. The program for RecSys 2017 reflects the growth of the Recommender Systems community. For the third time in the history of RecSys we offer two parallel tracks during the three days of the main conference with 106 contributions including 46 technical papers, 9 doctoral symposium papers, 12 industry papers, five tutorials, four keynotes, seven demos and 23 posters. We again offer an extensive pre- and post-conference program with twelve workshops, the RecSys Challenge and the doctoral symposium, which was held at Free University of Bozen-Bolzano on August 25th. Building on the tradition established by previous years, RecSys 2017 features a strong focus on significant real-world challenges facing industrial practitioners and practical solutions to those challenges. The three industry sessions feature a rich set of talks from: Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Dressipi, Farfetch, Netflix, AirBnB, Skyscanner, CloudAcademy, LinkedIn, Blendle, Aptus and Cheetah Mobile. A wide range of domains are represented in these sessions including eCommerce, news, advertising, recruiting, movies, television, fashion, tourism and eLearning. This year's conference has truly been a product of the vibrant and supportive community, and the vast cohort of amazing volunteers. We would like to thank all the members of the organizing committee for their generosity, initiative, and brilliant execution. We are tremendously grateful to the 25 senior and 145 regular Program Committee members, who volunteered their time and generated around 750 detailed reviews and 400 discussion comments."

    "title": "Learning to recommend with explicit and implicit social relations",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been well studied and developed, both in academia and in industry recently. However, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the connections among users, which is not consistent with the real-world observations where we always turn to our trusted friends for recommendations. Aiming at modeling recommender systems more accurately and realistically, we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis framework which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends' favors together. The proposed framework is quite general, and it can also be applied to pure user-item rating matrix even if we do not have explicit social trust information among users. In this framework, we coin the term social trust ensemble to represent the formulation of the social trust restrictions on the recommender systems. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."

    "title": "Modeling User Preferences in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are firmly established as a standard technology for assisting users with their choices; however, little attention has been paid to the application of the user model in recommender systems, particularly the variability and noise that are an intrinsic part of human behavior and activity. To enable recommender systems to suggest items that are useful to a particular user, it can be essential to understand the user and his or her interactions with the system. These interactions typically manifest themselves as explicit and implicit user feedback that provides the key indicators for modeling users\u2019 preferences for items and essential information for personalizing recommendations. In this article, we propose a classification framework for the use of explicit and implicit user feedback in recommender systems based on a set of distinct properties that include Cognitive Effort, User Model, Scale of Measurement, and Domain Relevance. We develop a set of comparison criteria for explicit and implicit user feedback to emphasize the key properties. Using our framework, we provide a classification of recommender systems that have addressed questions about user feedback, and we review state-of-the-art techniques to improve such user feedback and thereby improve the performance of the recommender system. Finally, we formulate challenges for future research on improvement of user feedback."

    "title": "TagiCoFi",
    "abstract": "Besides the rating information, an increasing number of modern recommender systems also allow the users to add personalized tags to the items. Such tagging information may provide very useful information for item recommendation, because the users' interests in items can be implicitly reflected by the tags that they often use. Although some content-based recommender systems have made preliminary attempts recently to utilize tagging information to improve the recommendation performance, few recommender systems based on collaborative filtering (CF) have employed tagging information to help the item recommendation procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called tag informed collaborative filtering (TagiCoFi), to seamlessly integrate tagging information into the CF procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that TagiCoFi outperforms its counterpart which discards the tagging information even when it is available, and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

    "title": "Privacy in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "In many online applications, the range of content that is offered to users is so wide that a need for automated recommender systems arises. Such systems can provide a personalized selection of relevant items to users. In practice, this can help people find entertaining movies, boost sales through targeted advertisements, or help social network users meet new friends.indent To generate accurate personalized recommendations, recommender systems rely on detailed personal data on the preferences of users. Examples are ratings, consumption histories, and personal profiles. Recommender systems are useful; however, the privacy risks associated to gathering and processing personal data are often underestimated or ignored. Many users are not sufficiently aware if and how much of their data is collected, if such data is sold to third parties, or how securely it is stored and for how long. indent This chapter aims to provide insight into privacy in recommender systems. First, we discuss different types of existing recommender systems. Second, we give an overview of the data that is used in recommender systems. Third, we examine the associated risks to data privacy. Fourth, relevant research areas for privacy-protection techniques and their applicability to recommender systems are discussed. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on applying and combining different privacy-protection techniques in real-world settings, making clear mappings to reflect typical relations between recommender system types, information types, particular privacy risks, and privacy-protection techniques."

    "title": "SoCo",
    "abstract": "Contexts and social network information have been proven to be valuable information for building accurate recommender system. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing works systematically combine diverse types of such information to further improve recommendation quality. In this paper, we propose SoCo, a novel context-aware recommender system incorporating elaborately processed social network information. We handle contextual information by applying random decision trees to partition the original user-item-rating matrix such that the ratings with similar contexts are grouped. Matrix factorization is then employed to predict missing preference of a user for an item using the partitioned matrix. In order to incorporate social network information, we introduce an additional social regularization term to the matrix factorization objective function to infer a user's preference for an item by learning opinions from his/her friends who are expected to share similar tastes. A context-aware version of Pearson Correlation Coefficient is proposed to measure user similarity. Real datasets based experiments show that SoCo improves the performance (in terms of root mean square error) of the state-of-the-art context-aware recommender system and social recommendation model by 15.7% and 12.2% respectively."

    "title": "Hybrid Recommender Systems for Electronic Commerce",
    "abstract": "In electronic commerce applications, prospective buyers may be interested in receiving recommendations to assist with their purchasing decisions. Previous research has described two main models for automated recommender systems - collaborative filtering and the knowledge-based approach. In this paper, we present an architecture for designing a hybrid recommender system that combines these two approaches. We then discuss how such a recommender system can switch between the two methods, depending on the current support for providing good recommendations from the behaviour of other users, required for the collaborative filtering option. We also comment on how the overall design is useful to support recommendations for a variety of product areas and present some directions for future work. Overview One of the tasks in the application area of knowledgebased electronic markets is that of providing recommendations to potential shoppers. In an environment where there is a wide choice for the prospective buyers, an automated system which serves to present a more narrow selection for the buyer would be desirable. Recommender systems are systems which provide recommendations to potential buyers. Two widely used techniques for building recommender systems to date are collaborative filtering and knowledge-based approaches. Collaborative filtering is a real-time personalization technique that leverages similarities between people to make recommendations (Greening 1998). other words, a collaborative filtering recommender system assumes that human preferences are correlated; thus, it predicts preferences and makes recommendations to one user based on the preferences of a group of users. In contrast, a knowledge-based recommender system exploits its knowledge base of the product domain to generate recommendations to a user, by reasoning about what products meet the user\u2019s requirements. In this paper, we analyze the advantages and shortcomings of both techniques and present an architecture for a hybrid recommender system that integrates the two approaches. Such a system will inherit all the strengths from a collaborative filtering recommender system, but will be able to avoid its weaknesses. Although there have been some proposals for designing systems which make use of both the knowledge-base approach and collaborative filtering (Burke 1999), collaborative filtering is used more in a post-processing stage, so that the knowledge-based design predominates. In this paper, we outline some specifications for changing between the collaborative filtering and the knowledge-based styles of recommendation, within a single system. This design strategy will be useful for electronic commerce applications where the number of buyers and the make-up of the community of buyers dictates whether collaborative filtering will be effective or not. Background In this section, we introduce the collaborative filtering and knowledge-based approaches in building recommender systems. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach as the motivation for the design of a hybrid architecture that combines the two approaches."

    "title": "Multi-Pointer Co-Attention Networks for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Many recent state-of-the-art recommender systems such as D-ATT, TransNet and DeepCoNN exploit reviews for representation learning. This paper proposes a new neural architecture for recommendation with reviews. Our model operates on a multi-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews are created equal, i.e., only a select few are important. The importance, however, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To this end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that extracts important reviews, subsequently matching them in a word-by-word fashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for prediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method operates with a novel gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the incorporation of discrete vectors within differentiable neural architectures. Our pointer mechanism is co-attentive in nature, learning pointers which are co-dependent on user-item relationships. Finally, we propose a multi-pointer learning scheme that learns to combine multiple views of interactions between user and item. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model via extensive experiments on \\textbf{24} benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art, with up to 19% and 71% relative improvement when compared to TransNet and DeepCoNN respectively. We study the behavior of our multi-pointer learning mechanism, shedding light on evidence aggregation patterns in review-based recommender systems."

    "title": "Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Networks with Label Smoothness Regularization for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs capture structured information and relations between a set of entities or items. As such knowledge graphs represent an attractive source of information that could help improve recommender systems. However, existing approaches in this domain rely on manual feature engineering and do not allow for an end-to-end training. Here we propose Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Networks with Label Smoothness regularization (KGNN-LS) to provide better recommendations. Conceptually, our approach computes user-specific item embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important knowledge graph relationships for a given user. This way we transform the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph and then apply a graph neural network to compute personalized item embeddings. To provide better inductive bias, we rely on label smoothness assumption, which posits that adjacent items in the knowledge graph are likely to have similar user relevance labels/scores. Label smoothness provides regularization over the edge weights and we prove that it is equivalent to a label propagation scheme on a graph. We also develop an efficient implementation that shows strong scalability with respect to the knowledge graph size. Experiments on four datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art baselines. KGNN-LS also achieves strong performance in cold-start scenarios where user-item interactions are sparse."

This paper addresses how to avoid privacy disclosure in collaborative recommender systems by comparing with major cryptology approaches and constructing a more efficient privacy-preserving collaborative recommender system based on the scalar product protocol."

    "title": "Applying associative retrieval techniques to alleviate the sparsity problem in collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are being widely applied in many application settings to suggest products, services, and information items to potential consumers. Collaborative filtering, the most successful recommendation approach, makes recommendations based on past transactions and feedback from consumers sharing similar interests. A major problem limiting the usefulness of collaborative filtering is the sparsity problem, which refers to a situation in which transactional or feedback data is sparse and insufficient to identify similarities in consumer interests. In this article, we propose to deal with this sparsity problem by applying an associative retrieval framework and related spreading activation algorithms to explore transitive associations among consumers through their past transactions and feedback. Such transitive associations are a valuable source of information to help infer consumer interests and can be explored to deal with the sparsity problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted an experimental study using a data set from an online bookstore. We experimented with three spreading activation algorithms including a constrained Leaky Capacitor algorithm, a branch-and-bound serial symbolic search algorithm, and a Hopfield net parallel relaxation search algorithm. These algorithms were compared with several collaborative filtering approaches that do not consider the transitive associations: a simple graph search approach, two variations of the user-based approach, and an item-based approach. Our experimental results indicate that spreading activation-based approaches significantly outperformed the other collaborative filtering methods as measured by recommendation precision, recall, the F-measure, and the rank score. We also observed the over-activation effect of the spreading activation approach, that is, incorporating transitive associations with past transactional data that is not sparse may \"dilute\" the data used to infer user preferences and lead to degradation in recommendation performance."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are information filtering tools that aspire to predict the rating for users and items, predominantly from big data to recommend their likes. Movie recommendation systems provide a mechanism to assist users in classifying users with similar interests. This makes recommender systems essentially a central part of websites and e-commerce applications. This article focuses on the movie recommendation systems whose primary objective is to suggest a recommender system through data clustering and computational intelligence. In this research article, a novel recommender system has been discussed which makes use of k-means clustering by adopting cuckoo search optimization algorithm applied on the Movielens dataset. Our approach has been explained systematically, and the subsequent results have been discussed. It is also compared with existing approaches, and the results have been analyzed and interpreted. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), standard deviation (SD), root mean square error (RMSE) and t-value for the movie recommender system delivers better results as our approach offers lesser value of the mean absolute error, standard deviation, and root mean square error. The experiment results obtained on Movielens dataset stipulate that the proposed approach may provide high performance regarding reliability, efficiency and delivers accurate personalized movie recommendations when compared with existing methods. Our proposed system (K-mean Cuckoo) has 0.68 MAE, which is superior to existing work (0.78 MAE) [1] and also has improvement of our previous work (0.75 MAE) [2]."

    "title": "Improving Recommender Systems by Incorporating Social Contextual Information",
    "abstract": "Due to their potential commercial value and the associated great research challenges, recommender systems have been extensively studied by both academia and industry recently. However, the data sparsity problem of the involved user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Many existing approaches to recommender systems cannot easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. In view of the exponential growth of information generated by online users, social contextual information analysis is becoming important for many Web applications. In this article, we propose a factor analysis approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization to alleviate the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy problems by incorporating social contextual information, such as social networks and social tags. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations. Moreover, the experimental results show that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the circumstance that users have made few ratings."

    "title": "Revisiting Graph Based Collaborative Filtering: A Linear Residual Graph Convolutional Network Approach",
    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCNs) are state-of-the-art graph based representation learning models by iteratively stacking multiple layers of convolution aggregation operations and non-linear activation operations. Recently, in Collaborative Filtering~(CF) based Recommender Systems~(RS), by treating the user-item interaction behavior as a bipartite graph, some researchers model higher-layer collaborative signals with GCNs. These GCN based recommender models show superior performance compared to traditional works. However, these models suffer from training difficulty with non-linear activations for large user-item graphs. Besides, most GCN based models could not model deeper layers due to the over smoothing effect with the graph convolution operation. In this paper, we revisit GCN based CF models from two aspects. First, we empirically show that removing non-linearities would enhance recommendation performance, which is consistent with the theories in simple graph convolutional networks. Second, we propose a residual network structure that is specifically designed for CF with user-item interaction modeling, which alleviates the over smoothing problem in graph convolution aggregation operation with sparse user-item interaction data. The proposed model is a linear model and it is easy to train, scale to large datasets, and yield better efficiency and effectiveness on two real datasets.

We illustrate some of the solutions discussed with reference to the TRAVEL DECISION FORUM prototype. The issues concern (a) the design of suitable preference elicitation and aggregation methods, in particular nonmanipulable aggregation mechanisms; and (b) ways of making members aware of each other's preferences and motivational orientations, such as the use of animated representatives of group members."

Although many studies have examined the algorithms and operational procedures relevant to personalized recommender systems, empirical evidence demonstrating relationships between social presence and two important outcomes of evaluating recommender systems\u2014reuse intention and trust\u2014remains lacking. To test the existence of a causal link between social presence and reuse intention, and the mediating role of trust between these two variables, this study conducted experiments varying the level of social presence while providing personalized recommendations to users based on their explicit preferences. This study also compared these effects in two different product contexts: hedonic and utilitarian. The results show that greater social presence increases both reuse intention and trust in the recommender systems. Moreover, the influence of social presence on reuse intention with respect to utilitarian products is less than that with respect to hedonic products.

    "title": "Translation-based Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Modeling the complex interactions between users and items as well as amongst items themselves is at the core of designing successful recommender systems. One classical setting is predicting users' personalized sequential behavior (or 'next-item' recommendation), where the challenges mainly lie in modeling 'third-order' interactions between a user, her previously visited item(s), and the next item to consume. Existing methods typically decompose these higher-order interactions into a combination of pairwise relationships, by way of which user preferences (user-item interactions) and sequential patterns (item-item interactions) are captured by separate components. In this paper, we propose a unified method, TransRec, to model such third-order relationships for large-scale sequential prediction. Methodologically, we embed items into a 'transition space' where users are modeled as translation vectors operating on item sequences. Empirically, this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a wide spectrum of real-world datasets. Data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/ruining-he/."

In this paper, we present our initial evaluation of the performance of our model-based personalised recommender systems over the 21-month period from May 2006 to January 2008, with particular focus on the added-value to the business. Our analysis covers shopper penetration, as well as the direct and indirect extra revenue generated by our recommender systems. One of the key lessons we have learnt during this case study is that the effect of a recommender system extends far beyond the direct extra revenue generated from the purchase of recommended items. The importance of maintaining updated model files was also found to be key to maintaining the performance of such model-based systems."

As to achieve optimal test results, we present appropriate surrogate objective functions for efficient training on MNAR data.

Methods A multidisciplinary, multi-organizational panel of experts in medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, urology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialist, and advocacy was convened to develop the clinical practice guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and case series published from 2000 through 2017. Results The systematic review identified 204 eligible publications. Much of the evidence consisted of systematic reviews of observational data, consensus guidelines, case series, and case reports. Due to the paucity of high-quality evidence on management of immune-related adverse events, recommendations are based on expert consensus. Recommendations Recommendations for specific organ system-based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert to grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d). Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require infliximab or other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, with the exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.

    "title": "Integrating Knowledge-based and Collaborative-filtering Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Knowledge-based and collaborative-filtering recommender systems facilitate electronic commerce by helping users find appropriate products from large catalogs. This paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques and introduces the possibility of a hybrid recommender system that combines the two approaches. An approach is suggested in which knowledge-based techniques are used to bootstrap the collaborative filtering engine while its data pool is small, and the collaborative filter is used as a postfilter for the knowledge-based recommender. Collaborative Filtering Collaborative filtering recommender system are a widelyaccepted technique in electronic commerce. (See [Resnick & Varian, 1997] and other articles in that special issue. A recent survey is found in [Maes, Guttman & Moukas, 1999]. See also [Goldberg et al. 1992] and [Resnick, et al. 1994].) These systems aggregate data about customers\u2019 purchasing habits or preferences and make recommendations to other users based on similarity in overall patterns. For example, in the Ringo music recommender system (Shardanand & Maes, 1995), users who had expressed their musical preferences by rating various artists and albums could get suggestions of other groups and recordings that others with similar preferences also liked. As a collaborative filtering system collects more ratings from more users, the probability increases that someone in the system will be a good match for any given new user. This beneficial property also has its downside, however. A collaborative filtering system must be initialized with a large amount of data, because a system with a small base of ratings is unlikely to be very useful. Further, the accuracy of the system is very sensitive to the number of rated items that can be associated with a given user (Shardanand & Maes, 1995). These factors contribute to a \u201cramp-up\u201d problem: until there is a large number of users whose habits are known, the system cannot be useful for most users, and until a sufficient number of rated items has been collected, the system cannot be useful for a particular user. Another problem with collaborative filtering systems might be called the \u201cbanana\u201d problem. Bananas are a frequently-purchased item in most American grocery stores, and the odds are high that any given market basket will contain bananas. A naive recommender system working from market basket data will always recommend bananas, simply because they are highly correlated with everything. Because the system has no notion of what foods ought to go together, it cannot screen out such suggestions. These drawbacks are not significant for some large ecommerce sites, such as Amazon.com, with a very large customer base, and a large and diverse product line that lends itself to multi-item purchases. A more difficult challenge is presented for a product such as an automobile that is bought much less frequently and one at a time. For an automobile, a home loan or any other infrequentlypurchased item, the system will not be able to use marketbasket or purchase history to make recommendations. A recommender system would never be able to say \u201cpeople who bought a Geo Metro also bought a Ford Escort,\u201d because that is not how people buy cars. Knowledge-based recommender systems What a recommender system for a car or other similar product must do is get information about users\u2019 preferences: Why are they buying a car? Is comfort or fuel economy more important? Based on such information, the system can pursue a knowledge-based approach to generating a recommendation, by reasoning about what products meet the user\u2019s requirements. The PersonalLogic recommender system offers a dialog that effectively walks the 1 The need to maintain user-identified logs of preferences and purchases also raises privacy concerns for collaborative filtering"

    "title": "Hierarchical Gating Networks for Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "The chronological order of user-item interactions is a key feature in many recommender systems, where the items that users will interact may largely depend on those items that users just accessed recently. However, with the tremendous increase of users and items, sequential recommender systems still face several challenging problems: (1) the hardness of modeling the long-term user interests from sparse implicit feedback; (2) the difficulty of capturing the short-term user interests given several items the user just accessed. To cope with these challenges, we propose a hierarchical gating network (HGN), integrated with the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) to capture both the long-term and short-term user interests. Our HGN consists of a feature gating module, an instance gating module, and an item-item product module. In particular, our feature gating and instance gating modules select what item features can be passed to the downstream layers from the feature and instance levels, respectively. Our item-item product module explicitly captures the item relations between the items that users accessed in the past and those items users will access in the future. We extensively evaluate our model with several state-of-the-art methods and different validation metrics on five real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on Top-N sequential recommendation."

    "title": "Privacy-preserving matrix factorization",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems typically require users to reveal their ratings to a recommender service, which subsequently uses them to provide relevant recommendations. Revealing ratings has been shown to make users susceptible to a broad set of inference attacks, allowing the recommender to learn private user attributes, such as gender, age, etc. In this work, we show that a recommender can profile items without ever learning the ratings users provide, or even which items they have rated. We show this by designing a system that performs matrix factorization, a popular method used in a variety of modern recommendation systems, through a cryptographic technique known as garbled circuits. Our design uses oblivious sorting networks in a novel way to leverage sparsity in the data. This yields an efficient implementation, whose running time is O(Mlog^2M) in the number of ratings M. Crucially, our design is also highly parallelizable, giving a linear speedup with the number of available processors. We further fully implement our system, and demonstrate that even on commodity hardware with 16 cores, our privacy-preserving implementation can factorize a matrix with 10K ratings within a few hours."

Although a personalized POI recommender system can significantly facilitate users' outdoor activities, it faces many challenging problems, such as the hardness to model user's POI decision making process and the difficulty to address data sparsity and user/location cold-start problem. To cope with these challenges, we define three types of friends (i.e., social friends, location friends, and neighboring friends) in LBSN, and develop a two-step framework to leverage the information of friends to improve POI recommendation accuracy and address cold-start problem. Specifically, we first propose to learn a set of potential locations that each individual's friends have checked-in before and this individual is most interested in. Then we incorporate three types of check-ins (i.e., observed check-ins, potential check-ins and other unobserved check-ins) into matrix factorization model using two different loss functions (i.e., the square error based loss and the ranking error based loss). To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments with many state-of-the-art baseline methods and evaluation metrics on two real-world data sets.

One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms."

Researchers have been attempting to improve their algorithms in order to issue better predictions to the users. However, one of the current challenges in the area refers to how to properly evaluate the predictions generated by a recommender system. In the extent of offline evaluations, some traditional concepts of evaluation have been explored, such as accuracy, Root Mean Square Error and P@N for top-k recommendations. In recent years, more research have proposed some new concepts such as novelty, diversity and serendipity. These concepts have been addressed with the goal to satisfy the users' requirements. Numerous definitions and metrics have been proposed in previous work. On the absence of a specific summarization on evaluations of recommendation combining traditional metrics and recent progresses, this paper surveys and organizes the main research that present definitions about concepts and propose metrics or strategies to evaluate recommendations. In addition, this survey also settles the relationship between the concepts, categorizes them according to their objectives and suggests potential future topics on user satisfaction."

In the light of this challenge, we propose a unified, comprehensive and efficient recommender system library called RecBole (pronounced as [rEk'[email protected]]), which provides a unified framework to develop and reproduce recommendation algorithms for research purpose. In this library, we implement 73 recommendation models on 28 benchmark datasets, covering the categories of general recommendation, sequential recommendation, context-aware recommendation and knowledge-based recommendation. We implement the RecBole library based on PyTorch, which is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. Our library is featured in many aspects, including general and extensible data structures, comprehensive benchmark models and datasets, efficient GPU-accelerated execution, and extensive and standard evaluation protocols. We provide a series of auxiliary functions, tools, and scripts to facilitate the use of this library, such as automatic parameter tuning and break-point resume.

We develop novel algorithms for estimating tag relevance and tag preference, and we conduct a user study exploring the roles of tag relevance and tag preference in promoting effective tagsplanations. We also examine which types of tags are most useful for tagsplanations."

    "title": "Adversarial Personalized Ranking for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Item recommendation is a personalized ranking task. To this end, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). Using matrix Factorization (MF) --- the most widely used model in recommendation --- as a demonstration, we show that optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works, we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR --- by optimizing MF with APR, it outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/hexiangnan/adversarial_personalized_ranking."

    "abstract": "Abstract Innovations in networked digital communications technologies, including the rise of \u201cBig Data,\u201d ubiquitous computing, and cloud storage systems, may be giving rise to a new system of social ordering known as algorithmic regulation. Algorithmic regulation refers to decisionmaking systems that regulate a domain of activity in order to manage risk or alter behavior through continual computational generation of knowledge by systematically collecting data (in real time on a continuous basis) emitted directly from numerous dynamic components pertaining to the regulated environment in order to identify and, if necessary, automatically refine (or prompt refinement of) the system's operations to attain a pre\u2010specified goal. This study provides a descriptive analysis of algorithmic regulation, classifying these decisionmaking systems as either reactive or pre\u2010emptive, and offers a taxonomy that identifies eight different forms of algorithmic regulation based on their configuration at each of the three stages of the cybernetic process: notably, at the level of standard setting (adaptive vs. fixed behavioral standards), information\u2010gathering and monitoring (historic data vs. predictions based on inferred data), and at the level of sanction and behavioral change (automatic execution vs. recommender systems). It maps the contours of several emerging debates surrounding algorithmic regulation, drawing upon insights from regulatory governance studies, legal critiques, surveillance studies, and critical data studies to highlight various concerns about the legitimacy of algorithmic regulation."

Simple correlation over time is typically not meaningful, since users change their preferences due to different external events. User behavior can often be determined by individual's long-term and short-term preferences. How to represent users' long-term and short-term preferences? How to leverage them for temporal recommendation? To address these challenges, we propose Session-based Temporal Graph (STG) which simultaneously models users' long-term and short-term preferences over time. Based on the STG model framework, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm Injected Preference Fusion (IPF) and extend the personalized Random Walk for temporal recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method using two real datasets on citations and social bookmarking, in which our proposed method IPF gives 15%-34% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based models possess fine representativeness of a target matrix, which is critically important in collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems. However, current NMF-based CF recommenders suffer from the problem of high computational and storage complexity, as well as slow convergence rate, which prevents them from industrial usage in context of big data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an alternating direction method (ADM)-based nonnegative latent factor (ANLF) model. The main idea is to implement the ADM-based optimization with regard to each single feature, to obtain high convergence rate as well as low complexity. Both computational and storage costs of ANLF are linear with the size of given data in the target matrix, which ensures high efficiency when dealing with extremely sparse matrices usually seen in CF problems. As demonstrated by the experiments on large, real data sets, ANLF also ensures fast convergence and high prediction accuracy, as well as the maintenance of nonnegativity constraints. Moreover, it is simple and easy to implement for real applications of learning systems."

In real-world recommendations such as e-commerce, a typical interaction between the system and its users is - users are recommended a page of items and provide feedback; and then the system recommends a new page of items. To effectively capture such interaction for recommendations, we need to solve two key problems - (1) how to update recommending strategy according to user's real-time feedback, and 2) how to generate a page of items with proper display, which pose tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we study the problem of page-wise recommendations aiming to address aforementioned two challenges simultaneously. In particular, we propose a principled approach to jointly generate a set of complementary items and the corresponding strategy to display them in a 2-D page; and propose a novel page-wise recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement learning, DeepPage, which can optimize a page of items with proper display based on real-time feedback from users. The experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in mobile devices and cloud-based music service now allow consumers to enjoy music anytime and anywhere. Consequently, there has been an increasing demand in studying intelligent techniques to facilitate context-aware music recommendation. However, one important context that is generally overlooked is user\u2019s venue, which often includes surrounding atmosphere, correlates with activities, and greatly influences the user\u2019s music preferences. In this article, we present a novel venue-aware music recommender system called VenueMusic to effectively identify suitable songs for various types of popular venues in our daily lives. Toward this goal, a Location-aware Topic Model (LTM) is proposed to (i) mine the common features of songs that are suitable for a venue type in a latent semantic space and (ii) represent songs and venue types in the shared latent space, in which songs and venue types can be directly matched. It is worth mentioning that to discover meaningful latent topics with the LTM, a Music Concept Sequence Generation (MCSG) scheme is designed to extract effective semantic representations for songs. An extensive experimental study based on two large music test collections demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed topic model and MCSG scheme. The comparisons with state-of-the-art music recommender systems demonstrate the superior performance of VenueMusic system on recommendation accuracy by associating venue and music contents using a latent semantic space. This work is a pioneering study on the development of a venue-aware music recommender system. The results show the importance of considering the influence of venue types in the development of context-aware music recommender systems."

We make use of a data set of simulated article recommendations based on actual content of one of the major Dutch broadsheet newspapers and its users (N=21,973 articles, N=500 users).

A particularly promising area is to extract energy-efficient transportation patterns (green knowledge), which can be used as guidance for reducing inefficiencies in energy consumption of transportation sectors. However, extracting green knowledge from location traces is not a trivial task. Conventional data analysis tools are usually not customized for handling the massive quantity, complex, dynamic, and distributed nature of location traces. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of extracting energy-efficient transportation patterns from location traces. Specifically, we have the initial focus on a sequence of mobile recommendations. As a case study, we develop a mobile recommender system which has the ability in recommending a sequence of pick-up points for taxi drivers or a sequence of potential parking positions. The goal of this mobile recommendation system is to maximize the probability of business success. Along this line, we provide a Potential Travel Distance (PTD) function for evaluating each candidate sequence. This PTD function possesses a monotone property which can be used to effectively prune the search space. Based on this PTD function, we develop two algorithms, LCP and SkyRoute, for finding the recommended routes. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed system can provide effective mobile sequential recommendation and the knowledge extracted from location traces can be used for coaching drivers and leading to the efficient use of energy."

Usually, the user-item matrix is quite sparse, which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. This paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors: (1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. First, we use the enhanced Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. Second, we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm, in which information of both users and items is taken into account. In this algorithm, we set the similarity threshold for users and items respectively, and the prediction algorithm will determine whether predicting the missing data or not. We also address how to predict the missing data by employing a combination of user and item information. Finally, empirical studies on dataset MovieLens have shown that our newly proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms and it is more robust against data sparsity."

Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms such as user- and item-based methods are the dominant techniques applied in RS algorithms. To improve recommendation quality, metadata such as content information of items has typically been used as additional knowledge. With the increasing popularity of the collaborative tagging systems, tags could be interesting and useful information to enhance RS algorithms. Unlike attributes which are \"global\" descriptions of items, tags are \"local\" descriptions of items given by the users. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any prior study on tag-aware RS. In this paper, we propose a generic method that allows tags to be incorporated to standard CF algorithms, by reducing the three-dimensional correlations to three two-dimensional correlations and then applying a fusion method to re-associate these correlations. Additionally, we investigate the effect of incorporating tags information to different CF algorithms. Empirical evaluations on three CF algorithms with real-life data set demonstrate that incorporating tags to our proposed approach provides promising and significant results."

The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such a manner, a good recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far beyond classical instant metrics and typically measured by long-term user engagement. Directly optimizing long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning~(RL) naturally fits the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are versatile to model, which typically consists of both instant feedback (eg. clicks) and delayed feedback (eg. dwell time, revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation. To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a RL framework --- FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement. FeedRec includes two components: 1)~a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical LSTM takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2)~a S-Network, which simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world large scale data show that FeedRec effectively optimizes the long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts."

Consequently, the design of personalized user interfaces and music recommender systems might benefit from understanding the relationship between personality and use of social media. Since there has not been a study between personality and use of Twitter at large, we set out to analyze the relationship between personality and different types of Twitter users, including popular users and influentials. For 335 users, we gather personality data, analyze it, and find that both popular users and influentials are extroverts and emotionally stable (low in the trait of Neuroticism). Interestingly, we also find that popular users are `imaginative' (high in Openness), while influentials tend to be `organized' (high in Conscientiousness). We then show a way of accurately predicting a user's personality simply based on three counts publicly available on profiles: following, followers, and listed counts. Knowing these three quantities about an active user, one can predict the user's five personality traits with a root-mean-squared error below 0.88 on a [1,5] scale. Based on these promising results, we argue that being able to predict user personality goes well beyond our initial goal of informing the design of new personalized applications as it, for example, expands current studies on privacy in social media."

The goals of the task force were (1) to clarify and simplify the current scoring rules, (2) to review evidence for new monitoring technologies relevant to the scoring rules, and (3) to strive for greater concordance between adult and pediatric rules. The task force reviewed the evidence cited by the AASM systematic review of the reliability and validity of scoring respiratory events published in 2007 and relevant studies that have appeared in the literature since that publication. Given the limitations of the published evidence, a consensus process was used to formulate the majority of the task force recommendations concerning revisions.The task force made recommendations concerning recommended and alternative sensors for the detection of apnea and hypopnea to be used during diagnostic and positive airway pressure (PAP) titration polysomnography. An alternative sensor is used if the recommended sensor fails or the signal is inaccurate. The PAP device flow signal is the recommended sensor for the detection of apnea, hypopnea, and respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) during PAP titration studies. Appropriate filter settings for recording (display) of the nasal pressure signal to facilitate visualization of inspiratory flattening are also specified. The respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals to be used as alternative sensors for apnea and hypopnea detection are specified. The task force reached consensus on use of the same sensors for adult and pediatric patients except for the following: (1) the end-tidal PCO2 signal can be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection in children only, and (2) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) belts can be used to monitor respiratory effort (thoracoabdominal belts) and as an alternative sensor for detection of apnea and hypopnea (PVDFsum) only in adults.The task force recommends the following changes to the 2007 respiratory scoring rules. Apnea in adults is scored when there is a drop in the peak signal excursion by \u2265 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative apnea sensor, for \u2265 10 seconds. Hypopnea in adults is scored when the peak signal excursions drop by \u2265 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for \u2265 10 seconds in association with either \u2265 3% arterial oxygen desaturation or an arousal. Scoring a hypopnea as either obstructive or central is now listed as optional, and the recommended scoring rules are presented. In children an apnea is scored when peak signal excursions drop by \u2265 90% of pre-event baseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor; and the event meets duration and respiratory effort criteria for an obstructive, mixed, or central apnea. A central apnea is scored in children when the event meets criteria for an apnea, there is an absence of inspiratory effort throughout the event, and at least one of the following is met: (1) the event is \u2265 20 seconds in duration, (2) the event is associated with an arousal or \u2265 3% oxygen desaturation, (3) (infants under 1 year of age only) the event is associated with a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute for at least 5 seconds or less than 60 beats per minute for 15 seconds. A hypopnea is scored in children when the peak signal excursions drop is \u2265 30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration study), or an alternative sensor, for \u2265 the duration of 2 breaths in association with either \u2265 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal. In children and adults, surrogates of the arterial PCO2 are the end-tidal PCO2 or transcutaneous PCO2 (diagnostic study) or transcutaneous PCO2 (titration study). For adults, sleep hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO2 (or surrogate) is > 55 mm Hg for \u2265 10 minutes or there is an increase in the arterial PCO2 (or surrogate) \u2265 10 mm Hg (in comparison to an awake supine value) to a value exceeding 50 mm Hg for \u2265 10 minutes. For pediatric patients hypoventilation is scored when the arterial PCO2 (or surrogate) is > 50 mm Hg for > 25% of total sleep time. In adults Cheyne-Stokes breathing is scored when both of the following are met: (1) there are episodes of \u2265 3 consecutive central apneas and/or central hypopneas separated by a crescendo and decrescendo change in breathing amplitude with a cycle length of at least 40 seconds (typically 45 to 90 seconds), and (2) there are five or more central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour associated with the crescendo/decrescendo breathing pattern recorded over a minimum of 2 hours of monitoring.Commentary:A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page 621.Citation:Berry RB; Budhiraja R; Gottlieb DJ; Gozal D; Iber C; Kapur VK; Marcus CL; Mehra R; Parthasarathy S; Quan SF; Redline S; Strohl KP; Ward SLD; Tangredi MM. Rules for scoring respiratory events in sleep: update of the 2007 AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. J Clin Sleep Med 2012;8(5):597-619.1.0 INTRODUCTIONIn 2007 the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) published rules for scoring respiratory events in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events, 1st ed.1 (hereafter referred to as the 2007 scoring manual). Widespread use of the rules has resulted in questions about rule interpretation and application. The 2007 scoring manual steering committee has addressed a number of questions concerning the respiratory rules on the scoring manual frequently asked questions (FAQs) page of the AASM website. Since 2007 several publications have addressed the impact of the respiratory scoring rules on the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in children and adults.2\u20135 Additional publications concerning the technology of respiratory monitoring have also appeared.6,7 Given these developments, the Board of Directors of the AASM considered the need for reappraisal of the scoring rules almost five years after publication. The Board of Directions subsequently appointed the Sleep Apnea Definitions Task Force (hereafter referred to as the task force) to consider possible revisions to the scoring rules and to make recommendations concerning changes.2.0 METHODSThe task force consisted of nine of the original thirteen individuals who authored the review8 of the evidence used to develop the 2007 respiratory scoring rules and four additional individuals with clinical experience in the application of the respiratory scoring rules. The task force met by conference call on several occasions and once face to face. The goals of the task force were: (1) to clarify and simplify the respiratory scoring rules, (2) to review evidence for new monitoring technologies relevant to the scoring rules, and (3) to strive for greater concordance between adult and pediatric rules. It is hoped that the discussion in this publication will prove useful in the clinical realm and stimulate further research concerning the existing knowledge gaps for which more evidence is needed.The task force reviewed the 1999 sleep related breathing disorders in adults consensus publication,9 the comprehensive scoring of respiratory events review that provided evidence for the 2007 scoring manual,8 and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd edition.10 A PubMed search for relevant articles published since 2005 was performed. The following terms were paired with numerous terms for respiratory events and relevant technology: scoring, interpretation, definition, validity, reliability, precision, measurement. Additional articles were pearled from relevant evidence papers.The strength of evidence for the task force recommendations includes (standard), (guideline), (consensus), or (adjudication).11 Standard recommendations are based on level 1 evidence or overwhelming level 2 evidence. Guideline recommendations are based on level 2 evidence or consensus of level 3 evidence. Consensus recommendations are based on consensus of the task force. Adjudication reflects consensus of the AASM Board of Directors when the task force was unable to make a recommendation. When there was an absence of high-level evidence,11 recommendations were based on consensus. A modified RAND consensus process12 was followed. The task force drafted respiratory definitions ballot items with a wide spectrum of possible definitions including the 2007 definitions. After initial voting on definitions, there was discussion and editing of items that failed to reach consensus. Voting and editing of definitions continued until a consensus was reached. All task force members disclosed potential conflicts of interest. Individual members abstained from voting on ballot questions concerning technology when there was a question of a potential conflict of interest based on prior research funding. The Board of Directors of the AASM reviewed the recommendations of the task force and requested clarification or suggested reappraisal of certain respiratory rules based on recent publications. Following further voting and editing, the Board of Directors approved a set of revised respiratory rules.Although proposed revisions to the rules are shown here at the conclusion of each section to make the discussion more understandable, the final and complete set of rules can be found in the online AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events, Version 2.0, which is a web-based document, amenable to updates as new literature emerges. This manuscript reviews the issues confronted by the task force during their review as well as the rationale behind the revisions. In the 2007 scoring manual, the levels of recommendation were: Recommended, Alternative, Optional. In this document the level \u201cAlternative\u201d is changed to \u201cAcceptable\u201d to correspond with terminology in the new scoring manual (Version 2.0) (Table 1). In the 2007 scoring manual, sensors were specified (recommended) for detection of apnea, hypopnea, and respiratory effort. Alternative sensors were specified for use if the recommended sensor failed or was not accurate. This terminology will be continued in this document (Table 1).Table 1 Levels of recommendation and sensor classificationTable 1 Levels of recommendation and sensor classification3.0 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS3.1 Technical Considerations for Adult and Pediatric PatientsIn considering the definitions of respiratory events, the task force recognized that most of the 2007 scoring manual definitions include a recommendation for the sensors to be used for event detection. While the major focus of the task force was to update the definitions of respiratory events, it was also necessary to consider sensor technology as it relates to event definitions. It must be recognized that the information obtained from any sensor depends critically on the proper placement of the sensor and appropriate adjustment of gain and filters for viewing the signal. To be accurate, some sensors may require calibration procedures. Filter settings were recommended for most signals of interest in the 2007 AASM scoring manual.1 It is also important to consider that validation of a sensor type manufactured by one company may not invariably generalize to other brands of the same type of sensor.3.1.1 Detection of Apnea and Hypopnea\u2014General ConsiderationsThe task force recommends a few changes and clarifications in the technical considerations section of the respiratory scoring rules chapter (Tables 2, 3, and 4). The 2007 scoring manual did not specify the sensor for detection of apnea and hypopnea during positive airway pressure (PAP) titration. PAP devices used for titration during polysomnography (PSG) have the ability to output an analog or digital signal from the internal flow sensor.13 Use of this signal to detect apnea and hypopnea during PAP titration is recommended in both the positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) titration clinical guidelines.14,15 Flattening of the inspiratory portion of the flow waveform provides evidence of airflow limitation and increased upper airway resistance.13,16 Based on consensus and clinical evidence, the task force recommends that the PAP device flow signal should be used to score apneas or hypopneas during PAP titration. Of note, the magnitude of oral airflow, if present, during a PAP titration with a nasal mask is not estimated by the PAP flow signal.Table 2 Recommended sensors for routine respiratory monitoringTable 2 Recommended sensors for routine respiratory monitoringTable 3 Alternative sensors for scoring respiratory events during diagnostic studyTable 3 Alternative sensors for scoring respiratory events during diagnostic studyTable 4 Other sensors for respiratory monitoringTable 4 Other sensors for respiratory monitoringWhile the 2007 scoring manual lists the use of respiratory inductance (inductive) plethysmography (RIP) sensors17\u201319 as alternative sensors for scoring apnea and hypopnea, the specific RIP signals to be used were not clearly specified. The available RIP signals include the dual RIP belt signals (thorax and abdomen), the RIPsum (sum of the thorax and abdomen belt signals) and the RIPflow (the time derivative of the RIPsum signal).18\u201320 Deflections in the RIPsum signal provide an estimate of tidal volume when RIP is calibrated.18,19,21 In uncalibrated RIP, deflections in the RIPsum signal allow detection of a relative change in tidal volume compared to baseline breathing.9,19,22 If the RIPsum signal is not available, a reduction in tidal volume can be inferred if there is a reduction in the excursions of the thoracic and abdominal belts.9,22 Of note, the pattern of undiminished excursions in the signals from the thoracoabdominal belts that are out of phase during an event is also consistent with a reduction in tidal volume (RIPsum). The RIPflow signal is a semi-quantitative estimate of airflow in calibrated RIP, and relative airflow in uncalibrated RIP.19,20,23\u201325 Calibration of the RIP signal is usually not performed in routine clinical PSG unless the technology for calibration during natural breathing26 is available. During apnea, the RIPsum and RIPflow signals show absent or minimal excursions, and during hypopnea, the excursions are diminished compared to baseline breathing.18,19 Of note, airflow limitation can be inferred from subtle qualitative changes in the inspiratory portion of the thorax RIP, abdominal RIP, and RIPsum signals,27 or from flattening of the inspiratory portion of the RIPflow waveform.19,20,28 The recommended RIP signals for scoring apnea and hypopnea events are specified in Tables 2 and 3.The 2007 scoring manual recommends use of the nasal pressure signal for scoring hypopnea in both adults and children. While the detection of hypopnea depends on the reduction in the amplitude of the signal, the inspiratory portion of the nasal pressure waveform provides additional useful information. Flattening of the shape of the inspiratory nasal pressure waveform is a surrogate for airflow limitation19,24,29\u201331 and is included in the respiratory effort related arousal (RERA) rules in the 2007 scoring manual.1 Visualization of flattening of the signal requires that the nasal pressure signal be recorded either as a DC signal or an AC signal with a low-frequency filter setting (cutoff frequency) that is sufficiently low (frequency cutoff 0.03 Hz or lower) (Figure 1).30 Snoring can also be detected as oscillations superimposed on the unfiltered nasal pressure signal32 if an appropriate high-frequency filter setting is used (100 Hz).1 The task force recommends that appropriate high and low filters settings be specified for nasal pressure recording in future revisions of the scoring manual.Figure 1: Nasal pressure signal displayed as a DC signal and as an AC signal with various low frequency filter settings (Hz)The direction of inspiration is upward. At a low filter setting of 0.1 Hz, the ability to demonstrate airflow flattening is impaired.Download Figure3.1.2 Sensors for Apnea DetectionIn the 2007 scoring manual the recommended sensor for detecting apnea in both adults and children is an oronasal thermal sensor (Table 1 for definition of recommended). Oronasal thermal sensors have the advantage of being able to detect both nasal and oral airflow. Thermal sensors detect a change in temperature between inhaled and exhaled gas. Here thermal airflow sensors include thermistors, thermocouples, or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensors.19,33\u201335 The task force found no evidence to change this recommendation for diagnostic sleep studies, although it broadened the definition of thermal sensors to include PVDF sensors.The 2007 scoring manual recommends somewhat different alternative sensors for apnea detection in adults (nasal pressure transducer or RIP) and children (nasal pressure transducer, end-tidal PCO2, and summed RIP) (Table 1 for definition of alternative). The nasal pressure signal is not the recommended sensor for apnea detection as the signal may show decrease excursions (decreased amplitude) during mouth breathing.32 Due to the non-linear characteristics of the nasal pressure signal (proportional to the flow squared), the signal underestimates low flow rates and could result in a hypopnea appearing to be an apnea.36 A square root transformation of the nasal pressure signal more closely approximates flow and minimizes this problem.As noted above, the excursions of the RIPsum and RIPflow signals usually have minimal amplitude during apnea.18,19,23 However, during obstructive apnea continued excursions in the RIPsum or RIPflow signals may be seen if the thorax and abdominal belt signals do not precisely sum to zero. This problem is minimized by calibration of the RIP signals; however, even the calibrated RIPsum may not remain accurate due to belt movement or changes in patient position.37Studies have evaluated the accuracy of RIPsum or RIPflow as a surrogate of tidal volume/airflow to detect apneas and hypopneas in adults23,38 and children.25 These studies usually analyzed the combination of apneas and hypopneas.23,38 That is, a separate analysis for apneas and hypopneas was not performed. In one study of calibrated RIP, the use of the RIPsum and RIPflow signals to determine the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) showed good agreement with a pneumotachograph (accurate flowmeter).23 Another study using uncalibrated RIP to determine the AHI found the intermeasurement agreement between use of the RIPsum and pneumotachograph to be considerably lower than between nasal pressure and pneumotachograph.38 A separate analysis for apnea and hypopnea detection was not performed. Respiratory belts utilizing a PVDF sensor can also provide a sum signal as well as thoracoabdominal signals. One study in adult patients being evaluated for suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) suggests that the PVDFsum signal may have utility as a method for apnea/hypopnea detection independent of direct airflow monitoring (nasal pressure or thermistry).6 The PVDFsum signal identified apnea based on a reduction in signal amplitude to 10% of baseline and hypopnea by a 50% reduction in signal. There was good agreement between classification of patients with an AHI \u2265 5/hour using PVDFsum compared to detection of airflow by thermistry and nasal pressure. In a separate part of the study, ten normal subjects simulated central and obstructive apneas while monitored with a pneumotachograph, RIP belts, and PVDF belts. Respiratory events defined as > 50% drop in signal amplitude were identified and compared. The PVDF sensor performed as well as the RIP when compared against the pneumotachograph in terms of the total number of respiratory events that were detected. Further evidence for the utility of the PVDF signals (thoracoabdominal belts or sum) to detect apnea/hypopnea is needed.In summary, there is evidence that RIPflow or RIPsum (in adults and children) or PVDFsum (in adults only) may be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection with the understanding that most studies analyzed the combination of apneas and hypopneas. Calibration of RIP may improve the accuracy of RIPflow and RIPsum, but a head-to-head comparison of AHI results using the same sensor, with and without calibration, has not been performed. Further comparisons between PVDFsum, RIPsum, or RIPflow, and an oronasal thermal sensor for detection of apneas (both central and obstructive) are needed.The end-tidal PCO2 signal is listed as an alternative sensor for apnea detection in pediatric patients in the 2007 scoring manual. A more accurate description of the signal is exhaled PCO2, but the phrase end-tidal PCO2 monitoring is widely used. Monitoring of exhaled PCO2 is routinely performed during pediatric PSG, and the absence of signal deflections (no CO2 exhaled) has been used to score apneas (Figure 2).1,39 The side stream method is most commonly used and consists of gas suctioned via a nasal cannula to an external sensor at bedside. Mouth breathing and occlusion of the nasal cannula can impair the ability of end-tidal PCO2 monitoring to detect apnea. One must remember that the magnitude of signal excursion depends entirely on the highest value of PCO2 in the exhaled breath rather than the magnitude of tidal volume or flow. Signal excursions can persist during inspiratory apnea if small expiratory puffs with a high PCO2 are present.40 A large study in infants compared the ability of the RIPsum, end-tidal PCO2, and oronasal thermistor monitoring to detect apnea.39 End-tidal PCO2 detected 182 of 196 apneas detected by either a thermistor or RIPsum.Figure 2: Use of the CO2 waveform to detect apneaHere RIPsum, RIPthorax, RIPabdomen are the summed, thorax, and abdominal signals from respiratory inductance plethysmography. The exhaled PCO2 is the capnography signal. The presence of apnea is documented by (A) oronasal thermal flow and (B) capnography. Note that the capnography signal lags behind the flow signal. The event depicted is an obstructive apnea. Thoracoabdominal paradox (D) is noted during the event but not during unobstructed breathing (C).Download FigureAfter review of the existing evidence, the task force decided upon recommended (Table 2) and alternative (Table 3) sensors for apnea detection. The task force concluded that the recommended sensor for apnea detection during diagnostic study should continue to be an oronasal thermal sensor in adults and children [Recommended] (Consensus). The task force also reached consensus on specification of the nasal pressure signal or the RIPsum or RIPflow signals from calibrated or uncalibrated RIP as the alternative (sensor) signals for apnea detection during diagnostic study in adults and children [Recommended] (Consensus). In adults the PVDFsum signal may also be used as an alternative sensor for apnea detection, although the ability to differentiate obstructive apneas versus hypopneas has not been defined [Acceptable] (Adjudication). The end-tidal PCO2 is another alternative apnea sensor in children if other sensors are not functioning or not available [Acceptable] (Consensus). As noted in the previous section, the PAP device flow signal is the recommended signal for apnea detection during PAP titration. Alternative sensors for apnea detection during PAP titration studies are not specified.3.1.3 Sensors for Hypopnea DetectionHypopnea detection requires a sensor to reliably detect a reduction in airflow or tidal volume. The gold standard for airflow detection is a pneumotachograph, usually placed in the outlet of a mask over the nose and mouth, which measures the pressure drop across a linear resistance.9,19,23,24,40 However, this technology is not practical for clinical studies. The 2007 scoring manual recommends a nasal pressure transducer with or without square root transformation as the recommended sensor for detection of airflow for identification of hypopnea in adults.1 In children the untransformed nasal pressure signal is recommended. The 2007 scoring manual also recommends somewhat different alternative hypopnea sensors for adults (calibrated or uncalibrated RIP, oronasal thermal sensor) and children (oronasal thermal sensor).As noted above, nasal pressure monitoring (nasal cannula connected to a pressure transducer) provides a signal proportional to the square of the flow.36 A square root transformation of the signal provides a more accurate estimate of flow, but the accuracy of the transformed nasal pressure signal typically deteriorates over a night of monitoring due to factors such as changes in catheter position.23 The effect of using a transformed rather than untransformed nasal pressure signal on the apnea hypopnea index is usually small; the AHI based on the transformed signal is slightly lower.1,23 The utility of nasal pressure monitoring has been documented in a significant number of publications19,23\u201325,29\u201332 and is sensitive to even subtle changes in airflow. The inspiratory portion of the nasal pressure waveform can display flattening, a surrogate of airflow limitation when using appropriate filter settings. As noted above, the major disadvantage of nasal pressure monitoring is the inability to detect or estimate the magnitude of oral airflow.32Oronasal thermistors and thermocouples detect the presence of airflow due to a change in sensor temperature, as exhaled gas is warmed to body temperature. The signal from these thermal devices is not proportional to flow33,41 and often overestimates flow as flow rates decrease.33 Excursions in the signal typically show some decrement during hypopnea, although not as prominent as those in the nasal pressure signal.19 Thermal sensors using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film produce a signal that is roughly proportional to the temperature difference between the two sides of the film and have a faster response time than thermistors or thermocouples.34,35 One study comparing the ability of an oronasal PVDF airflow sensor to a pneumotachograph in ten patients with OSA found that the output of a PVDF airflow sensor tracked the magnitude of changes in flow with reasonable accuracy.34 Although this study did not directly compare the PVDF sensor to traditional thermal sensors, it does suggest that PVDF sensors more accurately estimate the magnitude of airflow.34 While the inspiratory PVDF waveform may not routinely exhibit flattening during airflow limitation, PVDF sensors have the"

    "abstract": "In the field of Artificial Intelligence Machine learning provides the automatic systems which learn and improve itself from experience without being explicitly programmed. In this research work a movie recommender system is built using the K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. The movielens dataset is taken from kaggle. The system is implemented in python programming language. The proposed work deals with the introduction of various concepts related to machine learning and recommendation system. In this work, various tools and techniques have been used to build recommender systems. Various algorithms such as K-Means Clustering, KNN, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering have been described in detail. Further, after studying different types of machine learning algorithms, there is a clear picture of where to apply which algorithm in different areas of industries such as recommender systems, e-commerce, etc. Then there is an illustration of how implementations and working of the proposed system are used for the implementation of the movie recommender system. Various building blocks of the proposed system such as Architecture, Process Flow, Pseudo Code, Implementation and Working of the System is described in detail. Finally, in this work for different cluster values, different values of Root Mean Squared Error are obtained. In this proposed work as the no of clusters decreases, the value of RMSE also decreases. The best value of RMSE obtained is 1.081648. The results given by the proposed system are better than the existing technique on the basis of RMSE value."

    "title": "Causal Intervention for Leveraging Popularity Bias in Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender system usually faces popularity bias issues: from the data perspective, items exhibit uneven (long-tail) distribution on the interaction frequency; from the method perspective, collaborative filtering methods are prone to amplify the bias by over-recommending popular items. It is undoubtedly critical to consider popularity bias in recommender systems, and existing work mainly eliminates the bias effect. However, we argue that not all biases in the data are bad -- some items demonstrate higher popularity because of their better intrinsic quality. Blindly pursuing unbiased learning may remove the beneficial patterns in the data, degrading the recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. This work studies an unexplored problem in recommendation -- how to leverage popularity bias to improve the recommendation accuracy. The key lies in two aspects: how to remove the bad impact of popularity bias during training, and how to inject the desired popularity bias in the inference stage that generates top-K recommendations. This questions the causal mechanism of the recommendation generation process. Along this line, we find that item popularity plays the role of confounder between the exposed items and the observed interactions, causing the bad effect of bias amplification. To achieve our goal, we propose a new training and inference paradigm for recommendation named Popularity-bias Deconfounding and Adjusting (PDA). It removes the confounding popularity bias in model training and adjusts the recommendation score with desired popularity bias via causal intervention. We demonstrate the new paradigm on latent factor model and perform extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Empirical studies validate that the deconfounded training is helpful to discover user real interests and the inference adjustment with popularity bias could further improve the recommendation accuracy."

    "abstract": "Group recommender systems introduce a whole set of new challenges for recommender systems research. The notion of generating a set of recommendations that will satisfy a group of users with potentially competing interests is challenging in itself. In addition to this we must consider how to record and combine the preferences of many different users as they engage in simultaneous recommendation dialogs. In this paper we introduce a group recommender system that is designed to provide assistance to a group of friends trying the plan a skiing vacation. The system uses the DiamondTouch interactive tabletop to allow up to 4 users to simultaneously engage in parallel recommendation sessions and we describe how personal and shared profiles and interaction spaces can be managed to generate sets of recommendations for the individual as well as the group."

    "title": "Interacting with Recommenders\u2014Overview and Research Directions",
    "abstract": "Automated recommendations have become a ubiquitous part of today\u2019s online user experience. These systems point us to additional items to purchase in online shops, they make suggestions to us on movies to watch, or recommend us people to connect with on social websites. In many of today\u2019s applications, however, the only way for users to interact with the system is to inspect the recommended items. Often, no mechanisms are implemented for users to give the system feedback on the recommendations or to explicitly specify preferences, which can limit the potential overall value of the system for its users. Academic research in recommender systems is largely focused on algorithmic approaches for item selection and ranking. Nonetheless, over the years a variety of proposals were made on how to design more interactive recommenders. This work provides a comprehensive overview on the existing literature on user interaction aspects in recommender systems. We cover existing approaches for preference elicitation and result presentation, as well as proposals that consider recommendation as an interactive process. Throughout the work, we furthermore discuss examples of real-world systems and outline possible directions for future works."

    "abstract": "To investigate the mechanism of inhibition of silver ions on microorganisms, two strains of bacteria, namely Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), were treated with AgNO3 and studied using combined electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis. Similar morphological changes occurred in both E. coli and S. aureus cells after Ag+ treatment. The cytoplasm membrane detached from the cell wall. A remarkable electron-light region appeared in the center of the cells, which contained condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. There are many small electron-dense granules either surrounding the cell wall or depositing inside the cells. The existence of elements of silver and sulfur in the electron-dense granules and cytoplasm detected by X-ray microanalysis suggested the antibacterial mechanism of silver: DNA lost its replication ability and the protein became inactivated after Ag+ treatment. The slighter morphological changes of S. aureus compared with E. coli recommended a defense system of S. aureus against the inhibitory effects of Ag+ ions. \u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

    "title": "Towards Conversational Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "People often ask others for restaurant recommendations as a way to discover new dining experiences. This makes restaurant recommendation an exciting scenario for recommender systems and has led to substantial research in this area. However, most such systems behave very differently from a human when asked for a recommendation. The goal of this paper is to begin to reduce this gap. In particular, humans can quickly establish preferences when asked to make a recommendation for someone they do not know. We address this cold-start recommendation problem in an online learning setting. We develop a preference elicitation framework to identify which questions to ask a new user to quickly learn their preferences. Taking advantage of latent structure in the recommendation space using a probabilistic latent factor model, our experiments with both synthetic and real world data compare different types of feedback and question selection strategies. We find that our framework can make very effective use of online user feedback, improving personalized recommendations over a static model by 25% after asking only 2 questions. Our results demonstrate dramatic benefits of starting from offline embeddings, and highlight the benefit of bandit-based explore-exploit strategies in this setting."

This information may be provided in a variety of forms ? ranging from a discussion between a patient and a health care provider to a health promotion advertisement, a consent form, or one of many other forms of health communication common in our society. Yet millions of Americans cannot understand or act upon this information. To address this problem, the field of health literacy brings together research and practice from diverse fields including education, health services, and social and cultural sciences, and the many organizations whose actions can improve or impede health literacy.

To date, results show that incorporating social relationship data \u2013 beyond consumption profile similarity \u2013 is beneficial only in a very limited set of cases. The main conjecture of this study is that the inconclusive results are, at least to some extent, due to an under-specification of the nature of the social relations. To date, there exist no clear guidelines for using behavioral theory to guide systems design. Our primary objective is to propose a methodology for theory-driven design. We enhance Walls et al.'s (1992) IS Design Theory by introducing the notion of \"applied behavioral theory,\" as a means of better linking theory and system design. Our second objective is to apply our theory-driven design methodology to social recommender systems, with the aim of improving prediction accuracy. A behavioral study found that some social relationships (e.g., competence, benevolence) are most likely to affect a recipient's advice-taking decision. We designed, developed, and tested a recommender system based on these principles, and found that the same types of relationships yield the best recommendation accuracy. This striking correspondence highlights the importance of behavioral theory in guiding system design. We discuss implications for design science and for research on recommender systems."

Recommender systems use collaborative filtering to recommend items by summarizing the preferences of people who have tendencies similar to the user preference. Traditionally, the degree of preference is represented by a scale, for example, one that ranges from one to five. This type of measuring technique is called the semantic differential (SD) method. Web adopted the ranking method, however, rather than the SD method, since the SD method is intrinsically not suited for representing individual preferences. In the ranking method, the preferences are represented by orders, which are sorted item sequences according to the users' preferences. We here propose some methods to recommed items based on these order responses, and carry out the comparison experiments of these methods."

    "abstract": "Most recommender systems work on single domains, i.e., they recommend items related to the same domain where users have expressed ratings. However, the integration of different domains into one recommender system could allow users to span over different types of items. For instance, users that have watched live TV programs could like to be recommended with on-demand movies, music, mobile applications, friends to connect to, etc. This paper focuses on cross-domain collaborative recommender systems, whose aim is to suggest items related to multiple domains. We first formalize the cross-domain problem in order to provide a common framework for the classification and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We later define a new class of cross-domain algorithms based on neighborhood collaborative filtering, either item-based or user-based. The main idea is to first model the classical similarity relationships (e.g., Pearson, cosine) as a direct graph and to later explore all possible paths connecting users or items in order to find new, cross-domain, relationships. The algorithms have been tested on three cross-domain scenarios artificially reproduced by partitioning the Netflix dataset."

In this paper we describe a recommender system we implemented and perform a quantitative comparison of two collaborative filtering (CF) and two global algorithms. Results show that collaborative filtering recommenders significantly outperform global algorithms that are currently used by dating sites. A blind experiment with real users also confirmed that users prefer CF based recommendations to global popularity recommendations. Recommender systems show a great potential for online dating where they could improve the value of the service to users and improve monetization of the service."

    "abstract": "Data sparsity is one of the most challenging problems for recommender systems. One promising solution to this problem is cross-domain recommendation, i.e., leveraging feedbacks or ratings from multiple domains to improve recommendation performance in a collective manner. In this paper, we propose an Embedding and Mapping framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation, called EMCDR. The proposed EMCDR framework distinguishes itself from existing cross-domain recommendation models in two aspects. First, a multi-layer perceptron is used to capture the nonlinear mapping function across domains, which offers high flexibility for learning domain-specific features of entities in each domain. Second, only the entities with sufficient data are used to learn the mapping function, guaranteeing its robustness to noise caused by data sparsity in single domain. Extensive experiments on two cross-domain recommendation scenarios demonstrate that EMCDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation methods."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) have become an inseparable part of our everyday lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) , which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field. We first recognize and illustrate that RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we propose an RLRS framework with four components, i.e., state representation, policy optimization, reward formulation, and environment building, and survey RLRS algorithms accordingly. We highlight emerging topics and depict important trends using various graphs and tables. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future."

However, we face an information overloading problem. How to mine valuable information from reviews to understand a user's preferences and make an accurate recommendation is crucial. Traditional recommender systems (RS) consider some factors, such as user's purchase records, product category, and geographic location. In this work, we propose a sentiment-based rating prediction method (RPS) to improve prediction accuracy in recommender systems. Firstly, we propose a social user sentimental measurement approach and calculate each user's sentiment on items/products. Secondly, we not only consider a user's own sentimental attributes but also take interpersonal sentimental influence into consideration. Then, we consider product reputation, which can be inferred by the sentimental distributions of a user set that reflect customers' comprehensive evaluation. At last, we fuse three factors-user sentiment similarity, interpersonal sentimental influence, and item's reputation similarity-into our recommender system to make an accurate rating prediction. We conduct a performance evaluation of the three sentimental factors on a real-world dataset collected from Yelp. Our experimental results show the sentiment can well characterize user preferences, which helps to improve the recommendation performance."

    "title": "AutoInt",
    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad or an item, is critical to many online applications such as online advertising and recommender systems. The problem is very challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id, item category) are usually sparse and high-dimensional, and (2) an effective prediction relies on high-order combinatorial features (a.k.a. cross features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding low-dimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method called the AutoInt to automatically learn the high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multi-head self-attentive neural network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature interactions in the low-dimensional space. With different layers of the multi-head self-attentive neural networks, different orders of feature combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for prediction but also offers good explainability.

    "title": "Density Functionals with Broad Applicability in Chemistry",
    "abstract": "Although density functional theory is widely used in the computational chemistry community, the most popular density functional, B3LYP, has some serious shortcomings: (i) it is better for main-group chemistry than for transition metals; (ii) it systematically underestimates reaction barrier heights; (iii) it is inaccurate for interactions dominated by medium-range correlation energy, such as van der Waals attraction, aromatic\u2212aromatic stacking, and alkane isomerization energies. We have developed a variety of databases for testing and designing new density functionals. We used these data to design new density functionals, called M06-class (and, earlier, M05-class) functionals, for which we enforced some fundamental exact constraints such as the uniform-electron-gas limit and the absence of self-correlation energy. Our M06-class functionals depend on spin-up and spin-down electron densities (i.e., spin densities), spin density gradients, spin kinetic energy densities, and, for nonlocal (also called hybrid) functionals, Hartree\u2212Fock exchange. We have developed four new functionals that overcome the above-mentioned difficulties: (a) M06, a hybrid meta functional, is a functional with good accuracy \"across-the-board\" for transition metals, main group thermochemistry, medium-range correlation energy, and barrier heights; (b) M06-2X, another hybrid meta functional, is not good for transition metals but has excellent performance for main group chemistry, predicts accurate valence and Rydberg electronic excitation energies, and is an excellent functional for aromatic\u2212aromatic stacking interactions; (c) M06-L is not as accurate as M06 for barrier heights but is the most accurate functional for transition metals and is the only local functional (no Hartree\u2212Fock exchange) with better across-the-board average performance than B3LYP; this is very important because only local functionals are affordable for many demanding applications on very large systems; (d) M06-HF has good performance for valence, Rydberg, and charge transfer excited states with minimal sacrifice of ground-state accuracy. In this Account, we compared the performance of the M06-class functionals and one M05-class functional (M05-2X) to that of some popular functionals for diverse databases and their performance on several difficult cases. The tests include barrier heights, conformational energy, and the trend in bond dissociation energies of Grubbs' ruthenium catalysts for olefin metathesis. Based on these tests, we recommend (1) the M06-2X, BMK, and M05-2X functionals for main-group thermochemistry and kinetics, (2) M06-2X and M06 for systems where main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions are all important, (3) M06-L and M06 for transition metal thermochemistry, (4) M06 for problems involving multireference rearrangements or reactions where both organic and transition-metal bonds are formed or broken, (5) M06-2X, M05-2X, M06-HF, M06, and M06-L for the study of noncovalent interactions, (6) M06-HF when the use of full Hartree\u2212Fock exchange is important, for example, to avoid the error of self-interaction at long-range, (7) M06-L when a local functional is required, because a local functional has much lower cost for large systems."

However, a combination of these two types of feedback provides another paradigm for recommender systems (RS). Their combination in a user preference model presents a number of challenges but can also overcome the problems associated with each other. In order to build an effective RS on combination of both types of feedback, we need to have comparative data allowing an understanding of the computation of user preferences. In this paper, we provide an overview of the differentiating characteristics of explicit and implicit feedback using datasets mined from Last.fm, an online music station and recommender service. The datasets consisted of explicit positive feedback (by loving tracks) and implicit feedback which is inherently positive (the number of times a track is played). Rather than relying on just one type of feedback, we present techniques for extracting user preferences from both. In order to compare and contrast the performances of these techniques, we carried out experiments using the Taste recommender system engine and the Last.fm datasets. Our results show that implicit and explicit positive feedback complements each other, with similar performances despite their different characteristics."

We observe that, while our target data are sparse for CF systems, related and relatively dense auxiliary data may already exist in some other more mature application domains. In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in a target domain by transferring knowledge about both users and items from auxiliary data sources. We observe that in different domains the user feedbacks are often heterogeneous such as ratings vs. clicks. Our solution is to integrate both user and item knowledge in auxiliary data sources through a principled matrix-based transfer learning framework that takes into account the data heterogeneity. In particular, we discover the principle coordinates of both users and items in the auxiliary data matrices, and transfer them to the target domain in order to reduce the effect of data sparsity. We describe our method, which is known as coordinate system transfer or CST, and demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering. We show that our proposed method can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art solutions for this problem."

There are three major challenges facing RS in Taobao: scalability, sparsity and cold start. In this paper, we present our technical solutions to address these three challenges. The methods are based on a well-known graph embedding framework. We first construct an item graph from users' behavior history, and learn the embeddings of all items in the graph. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is incorporated into the graph embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information. Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using A/B test, we show that the online Click-Through-Rates (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous collaborative filtering based methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao's live production environment."

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) has been widely employed within recommender systems to solve many real-world problems. Learning effective latent factors plays the most important role in collaborative filtering. Traditional CF methods based upon matrix factorization techniques learn the latent factors from the user-item ratings and suffer from the cold start problem as well as the sparsity problem. Some improved CF methods enrich the priors on the latent factors by incorporating side information as regularization. However, the learned latent factors may not be very effective due to the sparse nature of the ratings and the side information. To tackle this problem, we learn effective latent representations via deep learning. Deep learning models have emerged as very appealing in learning effective representations in many applications. In particular, we propose a general deep architecture for CF by integrating matrix factorization with deep feature learning. We provide a natural instantiations of our architecture by combining probabilistic matrix factorization with marginalized denoising stacked auto-encoders. The combined framework leads to a parsimonious fit over the latent features as indicated by its improved performance in comparison to prior state-of-art models over four large datasets for the tasks of movie/book recommendation and response prediction."

In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering approach that addresses the item ranking problem directly by modeling user preferences derived from the ratings. We measure the similarity between users based on the correlation between their rankings of the items rather than the rating values and propose new collaborative filtering algorithms for ranking items based on the preferences of similar users. Experimental results on real world movie rating data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional collaborative filtering algorithms significantly on the NDCG measure for evaluating ranked results."

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been utilized as useful side information to improve recommendation quality. In those recommender systems, knowledge graph information often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness among items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality knowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two challenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse supervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world knowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections between items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity dependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which significantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate representation of user's preference. To fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge graph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph augmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit additional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased user-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves strong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, long-tail and noisy KG entities.

    "abstract": "As social animals, attending group activities is an indispensable part in people's daily social life, and it is an important task for recommender systems to suggest satisfying activities to a group of users. The major challenge in this task is how to aggregate personal preferences of group members to infer the decision of a group. Conventional group recommendation methods applied a predefined strategy for preference aggregation. However, these static strategies are too simple to model the real and complex process of group decision-making, especially for occasional groups which are formed ad-hoc. Moreover, group members should have non-uniform influences or weights in a group, and the weight of a user can be varied in different groups. Therefore, an ideal group recommender system should be able to accurately learn not only users' personal preferences but also the preference aggregation strategy from data. In this paper, we propose a novel group recommender system, namely SIGR (short for \"Social Influence-based Group Recommender\"), which takes an attention mechanism and a bipartite graph embedding model BGEM as building blocks. Specifically, we adopt an attention mechanism to learn each user's social influence and adapt their social influences to different groups and develop a novel deep social influence learning framework to exploit and integrate users' global and local social network structure information to further improve the estimation of users' social influences. BGEM is extended to model group-item interactions. In order to overcome the limitation and sparsity of the interaction data generated by occasional groups, we propose two model optimization approaches to seamlessly integrate the user-item interaction data. We create two large-scale benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed SIGR by comparing with state-of-the-art group recommender models."

In order to quickly find favorite items from vast resources, users are eager for technology by which websites can automatically deliver items in which they may be interested. Thus, recommender systems are created and developed to automate the recommendation process. In the field of collaborative filtering recommendations, the accuracy requirement of the recommendation algorithm always makes it complex and difficult to implement one algorithm. The slope one algorithm is not only easy to implement but also works efficient and effective. However, the prediction accuracy of the slope one algorithm is not very high. Moreover, the slope one algorithm does not perform so well when dealing with personalized recommendation tasks that concern the relationship among users. To solve these problems, we propose a slope one algorithm based on the fusion of trusted data and user similarity, which can be deployed in various recommender systems. This algorithm comprises three procedures. First, we should select trusted data. Second, we should calculate the similarity between users. Third, we need to add this similarity to the weight factor of the improved slope one algorithm, and then, we get the final recommendation equation. We have carried out a number of experiments with the Amazon dataset, and the results prove that our recommender algorithm performs more accurately than the traditional slope one algorithm."

We formulate the problem of predicting student performance as a recommender system problem and present matrix factorization methods, which are currently known as the most effective recommendation approaches, to implicitly take into account the prevailing latent factors (e.g. \u201cslip\u201d and \u201cguess\u201d) for predicting student performance. As a learner\u2019s knowledge improves over time, too, we propose tensor factorization methods to take the temporal effect into account. Finally, some experimental results and discussions are provided to validate the proposed approach."

    "title": "Web Service Recommendation via Exploiting Location and QoS Information",
    "abstract": "Web services are integrated software components for the support of interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Web services have been widely employed for building service-oriented applications in both industry and academia in recent years. The number of publicly available Web services is steadily increasing on the Internet. However, this proliferation makes it hard for a user to select a proper Web service among a large amount of service candidates. An inappropriate service selection may cause many problems (e.g., ill-suited performance) to the resulting applications. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering-based Web service recommender system to help users select services with optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS) performance. Our recommender system employs the location information and QoS values to cluster users and services, and makes personalized service recommendation for users based on the clustering results. Compared with existing service recommendation methods, our approach achieves considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy. Comprehensive experiments are conducted involving more than 1.5 million QoS records of real-world Web services to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

This paper proposes to build open recommender systems which can utilise Linked Data to mitigate the new-user, new-item and sparsity problems of collaborative recommender systems. We describe how to aggregate data about object centred sociality from different sources and how to process it for collaborative recommendation. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we augment the data from a closed collaborative music recommender system with Linked Data, and significantly improve its precision and recall."

    "abstract": "Intelligent data handling techniques are beneficial for users; to store, process, analyze and access the vast amount of information produced by electronic and automated devices. The leading approach is to use recommender systems (RS) to extract relevant information from the vast amount of knowledge. However, early recommender systems emerged without the cognizance to contextualize information regarding users\u2019 recommendations. Considering the historical methodological limitations, Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) are now deployed, which leverage contextual information in addition to the classical two-dimensional search processes, providing better-personalized user recommendations. This paper presents a review of recent developmental processes as a fountainhead for the research of a context-aware recommender system. This work contributes by taking an integrated approach to the complete CARS developmental process, unlike other review papers, which only address a specific aspect of the CARS process. First, an in-depth review is presented pertaining to the state-of-the-art and classified literature, considering the domain of the application models, filters, extraction and evaluation approaches. Second, viewpoints are presented relating to the extraction of literature with analysis on the merit and demerit of each, and the evolving processes between them. Finally, the outstanding challenges and opportunities for future research directions are highlighted."

    "abstract": "For recommender systems that base their product rankings primarily on a measure of similarity between items and the user query, it can often happen that products on the recommendation list are highly similar to each other and lack diversity. In this article we argue that the motivation of diversity research is to increase the probability of retrieving unusual or novel items which are relevant to the user and introduce a methodology to evaluate their performance in terms of novel item retrieval. Moreover, noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we formulate the trade-off between diversity and matching quality as a binary optimization problem, with an input control parameter allowing explicit tuning of this trade-off. We study solution strategies to the optimization problem and demonstrate the importance of the control parameter in obtaining desired system performance. The methods are evaluated for collaborative recommendation using two datasets and case-based recommendation using a synthetic dataset constructed from the public-domain Travel dataset."

Users searching for products or content have endless number of Web pages to navigate and require enormous efforts, requires judgmental aptitude and intuitiveness to extract meaningful information from the enormous data. Context aware Recommender systems are meant to be an important solution to the data overload and skewed information problem that persists today in World Wide Web. One of the major challenges in the context aware recommender system is the selection of relevant contexts. The selection of a few most relevant contexts are important for accuracy in the recommender output, as irrelevant contexts decreases the accuracy of recommender output and also increases the computational complexity. There are various methods used for relevant context selection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has the advantage of dimensionality reduction that makes data processing efficient. Although PCA cannot be directly used for context selection, PCA can be used to extract the principal components those are linear functions of original contexts. In this paper, we propose an approach that does weighing of original features (contexts) from the principal components to determine the most relevant contexts. This approach is advantageous in terms of computational complexity due to dimensional reduction."

    "title": "Time Interval Aware Self-Attention for Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems seek to exploit the order of users' interactions, in order to predict their next action based on the context of what they have done recently. Traditionally, Markov Chains(MCs), and more recently Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Self Attention (SA) have proliferated due to their ability to capture the dynamics of sequential patterns. However a simplifying assumption made by most of these models is to regard interaction histories as ordered sequences, without regard for the time intervals between each interaction (i.e., they model the time-order but not the actual timestamp). In this paper, we seek to explicitly model the timestamps of interactions within a sequential modeling framework to explore the influence of different time intervals on next item prediction. We propose TiSASRec (Time Interval aware Self-attention based sequential recommendation), which models both the absolute positions of items as well as the time intervals between them in a sequence. Extensive empirical studies show the features of TiSASRec under different settings and compare the performance of self-attention with different positional encodings. Furthermore, experimental results show that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models on both sparse and dense datasets and different evaluation metrics."

Being applied in various domains, recommender systems were designed to generate suggestions such as items or services based on user interests. Basically, recommender systems experience many issues which reflects dwindled effectiveness. Integrating powerful data management techniques to recommender systems can address such issues and the recommendations quality can be increased significantly. Recent research on recommender systems reveals an idea of utilizing social network data to enhance traditional recommender system with better prediction and improved accuracy. This paper expresses views on social network data based recommender systems by considering usage of various recommendation algorithms, functionalities of systems, different types of interfaces, filtering techniques, and artificial intelligence techniques. After examining the depths of objectives, methodologies, and data sources of the existing models, the paper helps anyone interested in the development of travel recommendation systems and facilitates future research direction. We have also proposed a location recommendation system based on social pertinent trust walker (SPTW) and compared the results with the existing baseline random walk models. Later, we have enhanced the SPTW model for group of users recommendations. The results obtained from the experiments have been presented."

    "title": "LARS*: An Efficient and Scalable Location-Aware Recommender System",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes LARS*, a location-aware recommender system that uses location-based ratings to produce recommendations. Traditional recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor items; LARS*, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS* exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS* exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS* can apply these techniques separately, or together, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the MovieLens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS* is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches."

    "abstract": "Most of existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right product to a user, based on whether the user is likely to purchase or like a product. On the other hand, the effectiveness of recommendations also depends on the time of the recommendation. Let us take a user who just purchased a laptop as an example. She may purchase a replacement battery in 2 years (assuming that the laptop's original battery often fails to work around that time) and purchase a new laptop in another 2 years. In this case, it is not a good idea to recommend a new laptop or a replacement battery right after the user purchased the new laptop. It could hurt the user's satisfaction of the recommender system if she receives a potentially right product recommendation at the wrong time. We argue that a system should not only recommend the most relevant item, but also recommend at the right time."

The decisions made by these systems can influence user beliefs and preferences which in turn affect the feedback the learning system receives - thus creating a feedback loop. This phenomenon can give rise to the so-called \"echo chambers\" or \"filter bubbles\" that have user and societal implications. In this paper, we provide a novel theoretical analysis that examines both the role of user dynamics and the behavior of recommender systems, disentangling the echo chamber from the filter bubble effect. In addition, we offer practical solutions to slow down system degeneracy. Our study contributes toward understanding and developing solutions to commonly cited issues in the complex temporal scenario, an area that is still largely unexplored."

Such facets include, for instance, defining the specific goals of the evaluation, choosing an evaluation method, underlying data, and suitable evaluation metrics. In this article, we consolidate and systematically organize this dispersed knowledge on recommender systems evaluation. We introduce the Framework for Evaluating Recommender systems (FEVR), which we derive from the discourse on recommender systems evaluation. In FEVR, we categorize the evaluation space of recommender systems evaluation. We postulate that the comprehensive evaluation of a recommender system frequently requires considering multiple facets and perspectives in the evaluation. The FEVR framework provides a structured foundation to adopt adequate evaluation configurations that encompass this required multi-facetedness and provides the basis to advance in the field. We outline and discuss the challenges of a comprehensive evaluation of recommender systems and provide an outlook on what we need to embrace and do to move forward as a research community."

In this paper, we propose a new data clustering method based on partitioning the underlying bipartite graph. The partition is constructed by minimizing a normalized sum of edge weights between unmatched pairs of vertices of the bipartite graph. We show that an approximate solution to the minimization problem can be obtained by computing a partial singular value decomposition (SVD) of the associated edge weight matrix of the bipartite graph. We point out the connection of our clustering algorithm to correspondence analysis used in multivariate analysis. We also briefly discuss the issue of assigning data objects to multiple clusters. In the experimental results, we apply our clustering algorithm to the problem of document clustering to illustrate its effectiveness and efficiency."

In this paper we show how these data can successfully be used to develop a recommender system (RS) that relies exclusively on the information encoded in the Web of Data. We implemented a content-based RS that leverages the data available within Linked Open Data datasets (in particular DBpedia, Freebase and LinkedMDB) in order to recommend movies to the end users. We extensively evaluated the approach and validated the effectiveness of the algorithms by experimentally measuring their accuracy with precision and recall metrics."

    "title": "A Novel Approach to Trust based Identification of Leaders in Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Recommender Systems has been a research hotspot in recent times as an efficient information filtering tool, to filter out useful required information from ever expanding web. The characteristics of social networks play a very important role towards behavioralmodeling of a trust network based Recommender System (RS). Similar to real world, in a social network also, it is important to objectively identify a member with high reputation who is heavily trusted by many members and hence his suggestions and inputs are most trust worthy for the whole community; that is, objective identification of leader is extremely important. In this paper, we propose a method to objectively identify leaders in a social network, we introduce new terms: Leadership score, prominence trust, peer inclusive factor, trust spread factor, trust maturity factor and trust penetration factors to portray a member more appropriately in a social network. We have calculated the leadership score using the real world dataset. Leadership score is taken as a linear additive function of prominence trust, engagement trust and peer inclusive factors with different weightage values. In our experiment, we have considered that leaders not only are followed by others, they are also socially engaged from their end to others in the social network. Prominence trust is a detailed characterization to get more accurate value of trust. Along with overall trust score, it is imperative to analyze more attributes to derive a more objective interpretation of the same. These attributes take care of trust score/reputation over period of time, number of trusting members, peer level interactions and also absolute score. To validate our leadership model in social network, we remove top 5%, 10% and top 20% of the members with high 'leadership score' and findout the reduction in the overall interactions. As further improvements to this work, a social network to be built with users and items and collect the data using positive and negative responses; use multiprogramming concepts to determine the optimum function for leadership score. This will aid towards further analysis and fine tuning of the models. Keywords: Data Mining, Recommender System, Social Network, Trust, Web Mining"

However, most recommendation approaches exploit only a single source of input data and suffer from the data sparsity problem and the cold start problem. To improve recommendation accuracy in this situation, additional sources of information, such as friend relationship and user-generated tags, should be incorporated in recommendation systems. In this paper, we revise the user-based collaborative filtering (CF) technique, and propose two recommendation approaches fusing user-generated tags and social relations in a novel way. In order to evaluate the performance of our approaches, we compare experimental results with two baseline methods: user-based CF and user-based CF with weighted friendship similarity using the real datasets (Last.fm and Movielens). Our experimental results show that our methods get higher accuracy. We also verify our methods in cold-start settings, and our methods achieve more precise recommendations than the compared approaches."

    "abstract": "Matrix completion models are among the most common formulations of recommender systems. Recent works have showed a boost of performance of these techniques when introducing the pairwise relationships between users/items in the form of graphs, and imposing smoothness priors on these graphs. However, such techniques do not fully exploit the local stationary structures on user/item graphs, and the number of parameters to learn is linear w.r.t. the number of users and items. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations by using geometric deep learning on graphs. Our matrix completion architecture combines a novel multi-graph convolutional neural network that can learn meaningful statistical graph-structured patterns from users and items, and a recurrent neural network that applies a learnable diffusion on the score matrix. Our neural network system is computationally attractive as it requires a constant number of parameters independent of the matrix size. We apply our method on several standard datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art matrix completion techniques."

The experiments in previous literature suggest that social information is very effective in improving traditional recommendation algorithms. However, explicit social information is not always available in most of the recommender systems, which limits the impact of social recommendation techniques. In this paper, we study the following two research problems: (1) In some systems without explicit social information, can we still improve recommender systems using implicit social information? (2) In the systems with explicit social information, can the performance of using implicit social information outperform that of using explicit social information? In order to answer these two questions, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis on three recommendation datasets. The result indicates that: (1) Implicit user and item social information, including similar and dissimilar relationships, can be employed to improve traditional recommendation methods. (2) When comparing implicit social information with explicit social information, the performance of using implicit information is slightly worse. This study provides additional insights to social recommendation techniques, and also greatly widens the utility and spreads the impact of previous and upcoming social recommendation approaches."

    "abstract": "Online social network information promises to increase recommendation accuracy beyond the capabilities of purely rating/feedback-driven recommender systems (RS). As to better serve users' activities across different domains, many online social networks now support a new feature of \"Friends Circles\", which refines the domain-oblivious \"Friends\" concept. RS should also benefit from domain-specific \"Trust Circles\". Intuitively, a user may trust different subsets of friends regarding different domains. Unfortunately, in most existing multi-category rating datasets, a user's social connections from all categories are mixed together. This paper presents an effort to develop circle-based RS. We focus on inferring category-specific social trust circles from available rating data combined with social network data. We outline several variants of weighting friends within circles based on their inferred expertise levels. Through experiments on publicly available data, we demonstrate that the proposed circle-based recommendation models can better utilize user's social trust information, resulting in increased recommendation accuracy."

Nevertheless we believe that certain domains demand the use of preference-based feedback. As such, we describe and evaluate a flexible recommendation strategy that has the potential to improve the performance of case-based recommenders that rely on preference-based feedback."

    "title": "Unbiased Recommender Learning from Missing-Not-At-Random Implicit Feedback",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems widely use implicit feedback such as click data because of its general availability. Although the presence of clicks signals the users' preference to some extent, the lack of such clicks does not necessarily indicate a negative response from the users, as it is possible that the users were not exposed to the items (positive-unlabeled problem). This leads to a difficulty in predicting the users' preferences from implicit feedback. Previous studies addressed the positive-unlabeled problem by uniformly upweighting the loss for the positive feedback data or estimating the confidence of each data having relevance information via the EM-algorithm. However, these methods failed to address the missing-not-at-random problem in which popular or frequently recommended items are more likely to be clicked than other items even if a user does not have a considerable interest in them. To overcome these limitations, we first define an ideal loss function to be optimized to realize recommendations that maximize the relevance and propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal loss. Subsequently, we analyze the variance of the proposed unbiased estimator and further propose a clipped estimator that includes the unbiased estimator as a special case. We demonstrate that the clipped estimator is expected to improve the performance of the recommender system, by considering the bias-variance trade-off. We conduct semi-synthetic and real-world experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method largely outperforms the baselines. In particular, the proposed method works better for less popular items that are less frequently observed in the training data. The findings indicate that the proposed method can better achieve the objective of recommending items with the highest relevance."

In a previous paper, we proposed a novel recommendation model that allows conversational systems to autonomously improve a fixed strategy and eventually learn a better one using reinforcement learning techniques. This strategy is optimal for the given model of the interaction and it is adapted to the users' behaviors. In this paper we validate our approach in an online CRS by means of a user study involving several hundreds of testers. We show that the optimal strategy is different from the fixed one, and supports more effective and efficient interaction sessions."

These systems thereby influence which information is easily accessible to us and thus affect our decision-making processes though the automated selection and ranking of the presented content. Automated recommendations can therefore be seen as digital nudges, because they determine different aspects of the choice architecture for users. In this work, we examine the relationship between digital nudging and recommender systems, topics that so far were mostly investigated in isolation. Through a systematic literature search, we first identified 87 nudging mechanisms, which we categorize in a novel taxonomy. A subsequent analysis then shows that only a small part of these nudging mechanisms was previously investigated in the context of recommender systems. This indicates that there is a huge potential to develop future recommender systems that leverage the power of digital nudging in order to influence the decision-making of users. In this work, we therefore outline potential ways of integrating nudging mechanisms into recommender systems."

Our recommender system supports the relatively labor-intensive task of domain analysis, potentially increasing opportunities for re-use, reducing time-to-market, and delivering more competitive software products.

In this paper, we develop a novel product recommender system called METIS, a MErchanT Intelligence recommender System, which detects users' purchase intents from their microblogs in near real-time and makes product recommendation based on matching the users' demographic information extracted from their public profiles with product demographics learned from microblogs and online reviews. METIS distinguishes itself from traditional product recommender systems in the following aspects: 1) METIS was developed based on a microblogging service platform. As such, it is not limited by the information available in any specific e-commerce website. In addition, METIS is able to track users' purchase intents in near real-time and make recommendations accordingly. 2) In METIS, product recommendation is framed as a learning to rank problem. Users' characteristics extracted from their public profiles in microblogs and products' demographics learned from both online product reviews and microblogs are fed into learning to rank algorithms for product recommendation. We have evaluated our system in a large dataset crawled from Sina Weibo. The experimental results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of our system.

Popular recommender systems model user preferences and item properties using a large amount of crowdsourced user-item interaction data, e.g., rating scores; then top-N items that match the best with a user\u2019s preference are recommended to the user. In this work, we show that an attacker can launch a data poisoning attack to a recommender system to make recommendations as the attacker desires via injecting fake users with carefully crafted user-item interaction data. Specifically, an attacker can trick a recommender system to recommend a target item to as many normal users as possible. We focus on matrix factorization based recommender systems because they have been widely deployed in industry. Given the number of fake users the attacker can inject, we formulate the crafting of rating scores for the fake users as an optimization problem. However, this optimization problem is challenging to solve as it is a non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop several techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. For instance, we leverage influence function to select a subset of normal users who are influential to the recommendations and solve our formulated optimization problem based on these influential users. Our results show that our attacks are effective and outperform existing methods."

    "title": "Each to his own",
    "abstract": "This paper compares five different ways of interacting with an attribute-based recommender system and shows that different types of users prefer different interaction methods. In an online experiment with an energy-saving recommender system the interaction methods are compared in terms of perceived control, understandability, trust in the system, user interface satisfaction, system effectiveness and choice satisfaction. The comparison takes into account several user characteristics, namely domain knowledge, trusting propensity and persistence. The results show that most users (and particularly domain experts) are most satisfied with a hybrid recommender that combines implicit and explicit preference elicitation, but that novices and maximizers seem to benefit more from a non-personalized recommender that just displays the most popular items."

    "title": "Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline",
    "abstract": "The aim was to formulate clinical practice guidelines for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). The Task Force included a chair selected by the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), seven experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration. This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force reviewed primary evidence and commissioned two additional systematic reviews. One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, and Americal Association for Clinical Chemistry reviewed drafts of the guidelines. The Task Force recommends that initial biochemical testing for PPGLs should include measurements of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines. Consideration should be given to preanalytical factors leading to false-positive or false-negative results. All positive results require follow-up. Computed tomography is suggested for initial imaging, but magnetic resonance is a better option in patients with metastatic disease or when radiation exposure must be limited. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy is a useful imaging modality for metastatic PPGLs. We recommend consideration of genetic testing in all patients, with testing by accredited laboratories. Patients with paraganglioma should be tested for SDHx mutations, and those with metastatic disease for SDHB mutations. All patients with functional PPGLs should undergo preoperative blockade to prevent perioperative complications. Preparation should include a high-sodium diet and fluid intake to prevent postoperative hypotension. We recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy for most pheochromocytomas with open resection for most paragangliomas. Partial adrenalectomy is an option for selected patients. Lifelong follow-up is suggested to detect recurrent or metastatic disease. We suggest personalized management with evaluation and treatment by multidisciplinary teams with appropriate expertise to ensure favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow."

    "title": "An MDP-based recommender system",
    "abstract": "Typical Recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more appropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the initial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markovchain model of user behavior whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models. We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based Recommender system."

    "title": "Controllable Multi-Interest Framework for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recently, neural networks have been widely used in e-commerce recommender systems, owing to the rapid development of deep learning. We formalize the recommender system as a sequential recommendation problem, intending to predict the next items that the user might be interacted with. Recent works usually give an overall embedding from a user's behavior sequence. However, a unified user embedding cannot reflect the user's multiple interests during a period. In this paper, we propose a novel controllable multi-interest framework for the sequential recommendation, called ComiRec. Our multi-interest module captures multiple interests from user behavior sequences, which can be exploited for retrieving candidate items from the large-scale item pool. These items are then fed into an aggregation module to obtain the overall recommendation. The aggregation module leverages a controllable factor to balance the recommendation accuracy and diversity. We conduct experiments for the sequential recommendation on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Taobao. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our framework has also been successfully deployed on the offline Alibaba distributed cloud platform."

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of online information, recommender systems play a key role to alleviate such information overload. Due to the important application value of recommender systems, there have always been emerging works in this field. In recommender systems, the main challenge is to learn the effective user/item representations from their interactions and side information (if any). Recently, graph neural network (GNN) techniques have been widely utilized in recommender systems since most of the information in recommender systems essentially has graph structure and GNN has superiority in graph representation learning. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of GNN-based recommendation models according to the types of information used and recommendation tasks. Moreover, we systematically analyze the challenges of applying GNN on different types of data and discuss how existing works in this field address these challenges. Furthermore, we state new perspectives pertaining to the development of this field.

    "title": "Providing Justifications in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are gaining widespread acceptance in e-commerce applications to confront the ldquoinformation overloadrdquo problem. Providing justification to a recommendation gives credibility to a recommender system. Some recommender systems (Amazon.com, etc.) try to explain their recommendations, in an effort to regain customer acceptance and trust. However, their explanations are not sufficient, because they are based solely on rating or navigational data, ignoring the content data. Several systems have proposed the combination of content data with rating data to provide more accurate recommendations, but they cannot provide qualitative justifications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that attains both accurate and justifiable recommendations. We construct a feature profile for the users to reveal their favorite features. Moreover, we group users into biclusters (i.e., groups of users which exhibit highly correlated ratings on groups of items) to exploit partial matching between the preferences of the target user and each group of users. We have evaluated the quality of our justifications with an objective metric in two real data sets (Reuters and MovieLens), showing the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches."

    "abstract": "The chronological order of user-item interactions can reveal time-evolving and sequential user behaviors in many recommender systems. The items that users will interact with may depend on the items accessed in the past. However, the substantial increase of users and items makes sequential recommender systems still face non-trivial challenges: (1) the hardness of modeling the short-term user interests; (2) the difficulty of capturing the long-term user interests; (3) the effective modeling of item co-occurrence patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a memory augmented graph neural network (MA-GNN) to capture both the long- and short-term user interests. Specifically, we apply a graph neural network to model the item contextual information within a short-term period and utilize a shared memory network to capture the long-range dependencies between items. In addition to the modeling of user interests, we employ a bilinear function to capture the co-occurrence patterns of related items. We extensively evaluate our model on five real-world datasets, comparing with several state-of-the-art methods and using a variety of performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the task of Top-K sequential recommendation."

Researchers need tools to help them find the papers they should read among all the papers published each year. In this paper, we present and experiment with hybrid recommender algorithms that combine Collaborative Filtering and Content-based. Filtering to recommend research papers to users. Our hybrid algorithms combine the strengths of each filtering approach to address their individual weaknesses. We evaluated our algorithms through offline experiments on a database of 102, 000 research papers, and through an online experiment with 110 users. For both experiments we used a dataset created from the CiteSeer repository of computer science research papers. We developed separate English and Portuguese versions of the interface and specifically recruited American and Brazilian users to test for cross-cultural effects. Our results show that users value paper recommendations, that the hybrid algorithms can be successfully combined, that different algorithms are more suitable for recommending different kinds of papers, and that users with different levels of experience perceive recommendations differently These results can be applied to develop recommender systems for other types of digital libraries."

    "title": "Poisoning Attacks to Graph-Based Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender system is an important component of many web services to help users locate items that match their interests. Several studies showed that recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker injects fake data to a given system such that the system makes recommendations as the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic to recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems that are not graph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based recommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in practice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store. However, how to design optimized poisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem. In this work, we perform a systematic study on poisoning attacks to graph-based recommender systems. Due to limited resources and to avoid detection, we assume the number of fake users that can be injected into the system is bounded. The key challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the target item is recommended to as many normal users as possible. To address the challenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, solving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm and its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but its parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is unknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based recommender systems. For instance, when 1% fake users are injected, our attack can make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain scenarios."

    "title": "A Cross-Domain Recommender System With Kernel-Induced Knowledge Transfer for Overlapping Entities",
    "abstract": "The aim of recommender systems is to automatically identify user preferences within collected data, then use those preferences to make recommendations that help with decisions. However, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity problem, which is particularly prevalent in newly launched systems that have not yet had enough time to amass sufficient data. As a solution, cross-domain recommender systems transfer knowledge from a source domain with relatively rich data to assist recommendations in the target domain. These systems usually assume that the entities either fully overlap or do not overlap at all. In practice, it is more common for the entities in the two domains to partially overlap. Moreover, overlapping entities may have different expressions in each domain. Neglecting these two issues reduces prediction accuracy of cross-domain recommender systems in the target domain. To fully exploit partially overlapping entities and improve the accuracy of predictions, this paper presents a cross-domain recommender system based on kernel-induced knowledge transfer, called KerKT. Domain adaptation is used to adjust the feature spaces of overlapping entities, while diffusion kernel completion is used to correlate the non-overlapping entities between the two domains. With this approach, knowledge is effectively transferred through the overlapping entities, thus alleviating data sparsity issues. Experiments conducted on four data sets, each with three sparsity ratios, show that KerKT has 1.13%-20% better prediction accuracy compared with six benchmarks. In addition, the results indicate that transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain is both possible and beneficial with even small overlaps."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are an essential tool to relieve the information overload challenge and play an important role in people's daily lives. Since recommendations involve allocations of social resources (e.g., job recommendation), an important issue is whether recommendations are fair. Unfair recommendations are not only unethical but also harm the long-term interests of the recommender system itself. As a result, fairness issues in recommender systems have recently attracted increasing attention. However, due to multiple complex resource allocation processes and various fairness definitions, the research on fairness in recommendation is scattered. To fill this gap, we review over 60 papers published in top conferences/journals, including TOIS, SIGIR, and WWW. First, we summarize fairness definitions in the recommendation and provide several views to classify fairness issues. Then, we review recommendation datasets and measurements in fairness studies and provide an elaborate taxonomy of fairness methods in the recommendation. Finally, we conclude this survey by outlining some promising future directions."

    "title": "Adaptive bootstrapping of recommender systems using decision trees",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems perform much better on users for which they have more information. This gives rise to a problem of satisfying users new to a system. The problem is even more acute considering that some of these hard to profile new users judge the unfamiliar system by its ability to immediately provide them with satisfying recommendations, and may quickly abandon the system when disappointed. Rapid profiling of new users by a recommender system is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories. The elicitation process becomes particularly effective when adapted to users' responses, making best use of users' time by dynamically modifying the questions to improve the evolving profile. In particular, we advocate a specialized version of decision trees as the most appropriate tool for this task. We detail an efficient tree learning algorithm, specifically tailored to the unique properties of the problem. Several extensions to the tree construction are also introduced, which enhance the efficiency and utility of the method. We implemented our methods within a movie recommendation service. The experimental study delivered encouraging results, with the tree-based bootstrapping process significantly outperforming previous approaches."

In this paper, we present a recommender system for CADAL digital library, namely CARES, which makes recommendations using a ranking-oriented collaborative filtering approach based on users' access logs, avoiding the problem of the lack of user ratings. Our approach employs mean AP correlation coefficients for computing similarities among users' implicit preference models and a random walk based algorithm for generating a book ranking personalized for the individual. Experimental results on real access logs from the CADAL web site show the effectiveness of our system and the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation performance."

Patients and Methods Clinical and laboratory data were gathered on 10,750 previously untreated symptomatic myeloma patients from 17 institutions, including sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate techniques. Three modeling approaches were then explored to develop a staging system including two nontree and one tree survival assessment methodologies. Results Serum beta 2 -microglobulin (S\u03b2 2 M), serum albumin, platelet count, serum creatinine, and age emerged as powerful predictors of survival and were then used in the tree analysis approach. A combination of S\u03b2 2 M and serum albumin provided the simplest, most powerful and reproducible three-stage classification. This new International Staging System (ISS) was validated in the remaining patients and consists of the following stages: stage I, S\u03b2 2 M less than 3.5 mg/L plus serum albumin \u2265 3.5 g/dL (median survival, 62 months); stage II, neither stage I nor III (median survival, 44 months); and stage III, S\u03b2 2 M \u2265 5.5 mg/L (median survival, 29 months). The ISS system was further validated by demonstrating effectiveness in patients in North America, Europe, and Asia; in patients less than and \u2265 65 years of age; in patients with standard therapy or autotransplantation; and in comparison with the Durie/Salmon staging system. Conclusion The new ISS is simple, based on easy to use variables (S\u03b2 2 M and serum albumin), and recommended for early adoption and widespread use."

So far, little research has been done to enable user interaction with such systems as a basis to support exploration and control by end users. In this paper, we present our research on the use of information visualization techniques to interact with recommender systems. We investigated how information visualization can improve user understanding of the typically black-box rationale behind recommendations in order to increase their perceived relevance and meaning and to support exploration and user involvement in the recommendation process. Our study has been performed using TalkExplorer, an interactive visualization tool developed for attendees of academic conferences. The results of user studies performed at two conferences allowed us to obtain interesting insights to enhance user interfaces that integrate recommendation technology. More specifically, effectiveness and probability of item selection both increase when users are able to explore and interrelate multiple entities -- i.e. items bookmarked by users, recommendations and tags."

    "title": "Hypergraph Contrastive Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) has emerged as fundamental paradigms for parameterizing users and items into latent representation space, with their correlative patterns from interaction data. Among various CF techniques, the development of GNN-based recommender systems, e.g., PinSage and LightGCN, has offered the state-of-the-art performance. However, two key challenges have not been well explored in existing solutions: i) The over-smoothing effect with deeper graph-based CF architecture, may cause the indistinguishable user representations and degradation of recommendation results. ii) The supervision signals (i.e., user-item interactions) are usually scarce and skewed distributed in reality, which limits the representation power of CF paradigms. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new self-supervised recommendation framework Hypergraph Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (HCCF) to jointly capture local and global collaborative relations with a hypergraph-enhanced cross-view contrastive learning architecture. In particular, the designed hypergraph structure learning enhances the discrimination ability of GNN-based CF paradigm, so as to comprehensively capture the complex high-order dependencies among users. Additionally, our HCCF model effectively integrates the hypergraph structure encoding with self-supervised learning to reinforce the representation quality of recommender systems, based on the hypergraph-enhanced self-discrimination. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and the robustness against sparse user interaction data.

The recommender system's main idea is to build relationship between the products, users and make the decision to select the most appropriate product to a specific user. There are four main ways that recommender systems produce a list of recommendations for a user - content-based, Collaborative, Demographic and hybrid filtering. In content-based filtering the model uses specifications of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. Collaborative filtering uses past behavior of the user like items that a user previously viewed or purchased, In summation to any ratings the user gave those items rate and similar conclusions made by other user's items list. To predicts items that the user may find interesting. Demographic filtering is view user profile data like age category, gender, education and living area to find similarities with other profiles to get a new recommender list. Hybrid filtering combines all three filtering techniques.

    "title": "GCN-Based User Representation Learning for Unifying Robust Recommendation and Fraudster Detection",
    "abstract": "In recent years, recommender system has become an indispensable function in all e-commerce platforms. The review rating data for a recommender system typically comes from open platforms, which may attract a group of malicious users to deliberately insert fake feedback in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their favour. The presence of such attacks may violate modeling assumptions that high-quality data is always available and these data truly reflect users' interests and preferences. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to construct a robust recommender system that is able to generate stable recommendations even in the presence of shilling attacks. In this paper, we propose GraphRfi - a GCN-based user representation learning framework to perform robust recommendation and fraudster detection in a unified way. In its end-to-end learning process, the probability of a user being identified as a fraudster in the fraudster detection component automatically determines the contribution of this user's rating data in the recommendation component; while the prediction error outputted in the recommendation component acts as an important feature in the fraudster detection component. Thus, these two components can mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our GraphRfi in the two tasks - robust rating prediction and fraudster detection. Furthermore, the proposed GraphRfi is validated to be more robust to the various types of shilling attacks over the state-of-the-art recommender systems."

    "abstract": "The traditional system of selecting courses to carry out research work is time consuming, risky and a tedious task, that not only badly affect the performance but the learning experience of a researcher as well. Therefore, choosing appropriate courses in seminal years could help to do research in a better way. This Study presents a recommender system that will suggest and guide a learner in selecting the courses as per their requirement. The Hybrid methodology has been used along with ontology to retrieve useful information and make accurate recommendations. Such an approach may be helpful to learners to increase their performance and improve their satisfaction level as well. The proposed recommender systems would perform better by mitigating the weakness of basic individual recommender systems."

    "abstract": "This article addresses open questions of the discussions in the first SIRTEL workshop at the EC-TEL conference 2007. It argues why personal recommender systems have to be adjusted to the specific characteristics of learning in Learning Networks. Personal recommender systems strongly depend on the context or domain they operate in, and it is often not possible to take one recommender system with a specific purpose from one context and transfer it to another context or domain. The article describes a number of distinctive differences for personalised recommendation to learners when compared to recommendations for consumers. Similarities and differences for informal and formal learning are discussed and used to define the recommendation goal that recommender systems in informal learning networks have to address. The article further suggests an evaluation approach for recommender systems in Learning Networks."

    "title": "Matrix Completion has No Spurious Local Minimum",
    "abstract": "Matrix completion is a basic machine learning problem that has wide applications, especially in collaborative filtering and recommender systems. Simple non-convex optimization algorithms are popular and effective in practice. Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithms converge from a good initial point, it remains unclear why random or arbitrary initialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convex objective function for \\textit{positive semidefinite} matrix completion has no spurious local minima --- all local minima must also be global. Therefore, many popular optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent can provably solve positive semidefinite matrix completion with \\textit{arbitrary} initialization in polynomial time. The result can be generalized to the setting when the observed entries contain noise. We believe that our main proof strategy can be useful for understanding geometric properties of other statistical problems involving partial or noisy observations."

    "abstract": "Influenced by the great success of deep learning in computer vision and language understanding, research in recommendation has shifted to inventing new recommender models based on neural networks. In recent years, we have witnessed significant progress in developing neural recommender models, which generalize and surpass traditional recommender models owing to the strong representation power of neural networks. In this survey paper, we conduct a systematic review on neural recommender models, aiming to summarize this field to facilitate researchers and practitioners working on recommender systems. Specifically, based on the data usage during recommendation modeling, we divide the work into collaborative filtering and information-rich recommendation: 1) collaborative filtering, which leverages the key source of user-item interaction data; 2) content enriched recommendation, which additionally utilizes the side information associated with users and items, like user profile and item knowledge graph; and 3) temporal/sequential recommendation, which accounts for the contextual information associated with an interaction, such as time, location, and the past interactions. After reviewing representative work for each type, we finally discuss some promising directions in this field."

    "title": "Developing a Knowledge Strategy",
    "abstract": "Today, knowledge is considered the most strategically important resource and learning the most strategically important capability for business organizations. However, many initiatives being undertaken to develop and exploit organizational knowledge are not explicitly linked to or framed by the organization's business strategy. In fact, most knowledge management initiatives are viewed primarily as information systems projects. While many managers intuitively believe that strategic advantage can come from knowing more than competitors, they are unable to explicitly articulate the link between knowledge and strategy. This article provides a framework for making that link and for assessing an organization's competitive position regarding its intellectual resources and capabilities. It recommends that organizations perform a knowledgebased SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis, comparing their knowledge to that of their competitors and to the knowledge required to execute their own strategy."

    "title": "Reinforcement Learning in Large Discrete Action Spaces.",
    "abstract": "Being able to reason in an environment with a large number of discrete actions is essential to bringing reinforcement learning to a larger class of problems. Recommender systems, industrial plants and language models are only some of the many real-world tasks involving large numbers of discrete actions for which current methods are difficult or even often impossible to apply. An ability to generalize over the set of actions as well as sub-linear complexity relative to the size of the set are both necessary to handle such tasks. Current approaches are not able to provide both of these, which motivates the work in this paper. Our proposed approach leverages prior information about the actions to embed them in a continuous space upon which it can generalize. Additionally, approximate nearest-neighbor methods allow for logarithmic-time lookup complexity relative to the number of actions, which is necessary for time-wise tractable training. This combined approach allows reinforcement learning methods to be applied to large-scale learning problems previously intractable with current methods. We demonstrate our algorithm\u2019s abilities on a series of tasks having up to one million actions."

    "title": "Knowledge Graph Embedding Based Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Question answering over knowledge graph (QA-KG) aims to use facts in the knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions. It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine. Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However, this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also, the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of possible answers large. To bridge the gap, we propose an effective Knowledge Embedding based Question Answering (KEQA) framework. We focus on answering the most common types of questions, i.e., simple questions, in which each question could be answered by the machine straightforwardly if its single head entity and single predicate are correctly identified. To answer a simple question, instead of inferring its head entity and predicate directly, KEQA targets at jointly recovering the question's head entity, predicate, and tail entity representations in the KG embedding spaces. Based on a carefully-designed joint distance metric, the three learned vectors' closest fact in the KG is returned as the answer. Experiments on a widely-adopted benchmark demonstrate that the proposed KEQA outperforms the state-of-the-art QA-KG methods."

    "abstract": "Inferring rankings over elements of a set of objects, such as documents or images, is a key learning problem for such important applications as Web search and recommender systems. Crowdsourcing services provide an inexpensive and efficient means to acquire preferences over objects via labeling by sets of annotators. We propose a new model to predict a gold-standard ranking that hinges on combining pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing. In contrast to traditional ranking aggregation methods, the approach learns about and folds into consideration the quality of contributions of each annotator. In addition, we minimize the cost of assessment by introducing a generalization of the traditional active learning scenario to jointly select the annotator and pair to assess while taking into account the annotator quality, the uncertainty over ordering of the pair, and the current model uncertainty. We formalize this as an active learning strategy that incorporates an exploration-exploitation tradeoff and implement it using an efficient online Bayesian updating scheme. Using simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that the active learning strategy achieves significant reductions in labeling cost while maintaining accuracy."

    "title": "Multiple objective optimization in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of optimizing recommender systems for multiple relevance objectives that are not necessarily aligned. Specifically, given a recommender system that optimizes for one aspect of relevance, semantic matching (as defined by any notion of similarity between source and target of recommendation; usually trained on CTR), we want to enhance the system with additional relevance signals that will increase the utility of the recommender system, but that may simultaneously sacrifice the quality of the semantic match. The issue is that semantic matching is only one relevance aspect of the utility function that drives the recommender system, albeit a significant aspect. In talent recommendation systems, job posters want candidates who are a good match to the job posted, but also prefer those candidates to be open to new opportunities. Recommender systems that recommend discussion groups must ensure that the groups are relevant to the users' interests, but also need to favor active groups over inactive ones. We refer to these additional relevance signals (job-seeking intent and group activity) as extraneous features, and they account for aspects of the utility function that are not captured by the semantic match (i.e. post-CTR down-stream utilities that reflect engagement: time spent reading, sharing, commenting, etc). We want to include these extraneous features into the recommendations, but we want to do so while satisfying the following requirements: 1) we do not want to drastically sacrifice the quality of the semantic match, and 2) we want to quantify exactly how the semantic match would be affected as we control the different aspects of the utility function. In this paper, we present an approach that satisfies these requirements."

    "title": "Learning Attribute-to-Feature Mappings for Cold-Start Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Cold-start scenarios in recommender systems are situations in which no prior events, like ratings or clicks, are known for certain users or items. To compute predictions in such cases, additional information about users (user attributes, e.g. gender, age, geographical location, occupation) and items (item attributes, e.g. genres, product categories, keywords) must be used. We describe a method that maps such entity (e.g. user or item) attributes to the latent features of a matrix (or higher-dimensional) factorization model. With such mappings, the factors of a MF model trained by standard techniques can be applied to the new-user and the new-item problem, while retaining its advantages, in particular speed and predictive accuracy. We use the mapping concept to construct an attribute-aware matrix factorization model for item recommendation from implicit, positive-only feedback. Experiments on the new-item problem show that this approach provides good predictive accuracy, while the prediction time only grows by a constant factor."

They provide people with suggestions for items which are likely to be of interest for them; hence, a primary function of recommender systems is to help people make good choices and decisions. However, most previous research has focused on recommendation techniques and algorithms, and less attention has been devoted to the decision making processes adopted by the users and possibly supported by the system. There is still a gap between the importance that the community gives to the assessment of recommendation algorithms and the current range of ongoing research activities concerning human decision making. Different decision-psychological phenomena can influence the decision making of users of recommender systems, and research along these lines is becoming increasingly important and popular. This special issue highlights how the coupling of recommendation algorithms with the understanding of human choice and decision making theory has the potential to benefit research and practice on recommender systems and to enable users to achieve a good balance between decision accuracy and decision effort."

    "title": "LCARS",
    "abstract": "Newly emerging location-based and event-based social network services provide us with a new platform to understand users' preferences based on their activity history. A user can only visit a limited number of venues/events and most of them are within a limited distance range, so the user-item matrix is very sparse, which creates a big challenge to the traditional collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city where they have no activity information. In this article, we propose LCARS, a location-content-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) or events (e.g., concerts and exhibitions) by giving consideration to both personal interest and local preference. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near the area in which they live, but also in a city that is new to them. Specifically, LCARS consists of two components: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part, called LCA-LDA, is designed to learn the interest of each individual user and the local preference of each individual city by capturing item cooccurrence patterns and exploiting item contents. The online recommendation part takes a querying user along with a querying city as input, and automatically combines the learned interest of the querying user and the local preference of the querying city to produce the top- k recommendations. To speed up the online process, a scalable query processing technique is developed by extending both the Threshold Algorithm (TA) and TA-approximation algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our recommender system on two real datasets, that is, DoubanEvent and Foursquare, and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The results show the superiority of LCARS in recommending spatial items for users, especially when traveling to new cities, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Besides, the experimental analysis results also demonstrate the excellent interpretability of LCARS."

    "title": "On Deep Learning for Trust-Aware Recommendations in Social Networks",
    "abstract": "With the emergence of online social networks, the social network-based recommendation approach is popularly used. The major benefit of this approach is the ability of dealing with the problems with cold-start users. In addition to social networks, user trust information also plays an important role to obtain reliable recommendations. Although matrix factorization (MF) becomes dominant in recommender systems, the recommendation largely relies on the initialization of the user and item latent feature vectors. Aiming at addressing these challenges, we develop a novel trust-based approach for recommendation in social networks. In particular, we attempt to leverage deep learning to determinate the initialization in MF for trust-aware social recommendations and to differentiate the community effect in user's trusted friendships. A two-phase recommendation process is proposed to utilize deep learning in initialization and to synthesize the users' interests and their trusted friends' interests together with the impact of community effect for recommendations. We perform extensive experiments on real-world social network data to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods."

The vast majority of traditional recommender systems consider the recommendation procedure as a static process and make recommendations following a fixed strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system with the capability of continuously improving its strategies during the interactions with users. We model the sequential interactions between users and a recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items from users' feedbacks. In particular, we introduce an online user-agent interacting environment simulator, which can pre-train and evaluate model parameters offline before applying the model online. Moreover, we validate the importance of list-wise recommendations during the interactions between users and agent, and develop a novel approach to incorporate them into the proposed framework LIRD for list-wide recommendations. The experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

Recommender systems that depend on previous user ratings (i.e., collaborative filtering, or CF) can address this problem for apps that have sufficient ratings from past users. But for apps that are newly released, CF does not have any user ratings to base recommendations on, which leads to the cold-start problem."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have already been engaging multiple criteria for the production of recommendations. Such systems, referred to as multicriteria recommenders, demonstrated early the potential of applying Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to facilitate recommendation in numerous application domains. On the other hand, systematic implementation and testing of multicriteria recommender systems in the context of real-life applications still remains rather limited. Previous studies dealing with the evaluation of recommender systems have outlined the importance of carrying out careful testing and parameterization of a recommender system, before it is actually deployed in a real setting. In this paper, the experimental analysis of several design options for three proposed multiattribute utility collaborative filtering algorithms is presented for a particular application context (recommendation of e-markets to online customers), under conditions similar to the ones expected during actual operation. The results of this study indicate that the performance of recommendation algorithms depends on the characteristics of the application context, as these are reflected on the properties of evaluations' data set. Therefore, it is judged important to experimentally analyze various design choices for multicriteria recommender systems, before their actual deployment."

A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as \u226580%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto. <h3>Results</h3> All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions after extensive modifications and omission of one clinical question were achieved with a consensus level of &gt;80%. To better organise classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on aetiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of <i>H. pylori</i>-associated dyspepsia together with a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate <i>H. pylori</i> infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimise the risk of more serious complications of the infection. <h3>Conclusions</h3> A global consensus for gastritis was developed for the first time, which will be the basis for an international classification system and for further research on the subject."

Accordingly, as a consequence of IoT and AI, multiple forms of data are incorporated in these systems, e.g. social, implicit, local and personal information, which can help in improving recommender systems' performance and widen their applicability to traverse different disciplines. On the other side, energy efficiency in the building sector is becoming a hot research topic, in which recommender systems play a major role by promoting energy saving behavior and reducing carbon emissions. However, the deployment of the recommendation frameworks in buildings still needs more investigations to identify the current challenges and issues, where their solutions are the keys to enable the pervasiveness of research findings, and therefore, ensure a large-scale adoption of this technology. Accordingly, this paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first timely and comprehensive reference for energy-efficiency recommendation systems through (i) surveying existing recommender systems for energy saving in buildings; (ii) discussing their evolution; (iii) providing an original taxonomy of these systems based on specified criteria, including the nature of the recommender engine, its objective, computing platforms, evaluation metrics and incentive measures; and (iv) conducting an in-depth, critical analysis to identify their limitations and unsolved issues.

    "abstract": "How can we learn a classifier that is \"fair\" for a protected or sensitive group, when we do not know if the input to the classifier belongs to the protected group? How can we train such a classifier when data on the protected group is difficult to attain? In many settings, finding out the sensitive input attribute can be prohibitively expensive even during model training, and sometimes impossible during model serving. For example, in recommender systems, if we want to predict if a user will click on a given recommendation, we often do not know many attributes of the user, e.g., race or age, and many attributes of the content are hard to determine, e.g., the language or topic. Thus, it is not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the sensitive attribute. Here, we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural network. In particular, we study how the choice of data for the adversarial training effects the resulting fairness properties. We find two interesting results: a small amount of data is needed to train these adversarial models, and the data distribution empirically drives the adversary's notion of fairness."

We train models to predict these design choices using one million dataset-visualization pairs collected from a popular online visualization platform. Neural networks predict these design choices with high accuracy compared to baseline models. We report and interpret feature importances from one of these baseline models. To evaluate the generalizability and uncertainty of our approach, we benchmark with a crowdsourced test set, and show that the performance of our model is comparable to human performance when predicting consensus visualization type, and exceeds that of other visualization recommender systems."

    "abstract": "We present a new hybrid meta exchange-correlation functional, called M05-2X, for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and noncovalent interactions. We also provide a full discussion of the new M05 functional, previously presented in a short communication. The M05 functional was parametrized including both metals and nonmetals, whereas M05-2X is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X) that is parametrized only for nonmetals. In particular, M05 was parametrized against 35 data values, and M05-2X is parametrized against 34 data values. Both functionals, along with 28 other functionals, have been comparatively assessed against 234 data values: the MGAE109/3 main-group atomization energy database, the IP13/3 ionization potential database, the EA13/3 electron affinity database, the HTBH38/4 database of barrier height for hydrogen-transfer reactions, five noncovalent databases, two databases involving metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies, a dipole moment database, a database of four alkyl bond dissociation energies of alkanes and ethers, and three total energies of one-electron systems. We also tested the new functionals and 12 others for eight hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction energies in nucleobase pairs, and we tested M05 and M05-2X and 19 other functionals for the geometry, dipole moment, and binding energy of HCN-BF3, which has recently been shown to be a very difficult case for density functional theory. We tested eight functionals for four more alkyl bond dissociation energies, and we tested 12 functionals for several additional bond energies with varying amounts of multireference character. On the basis of all the results for 256 data values in 18 databases in the present study, we recommend M05-2X, M05, PW6B95, PWB6K, and MPWB1K for general-purpose applications in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions involving nonmetals and we recommend M05 for studies involving both metallic and nonmetallic elements. The M05 functional, essentially uniquely among the functionals with broad applicability to chemistry, also performs well not only for main-group thermochemistry and radical reaction barrier heights but also for transition-metal-transition-metal interactions. The M05-2X functional has the best performance for thermochemical kinetics, noncovalent interactions (especially weak interaction, hydrogen bonding, \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking, and interactions energies of nucleobases), and alkyl bond dissociation energies and the best composite results for energetics, excluding metals."

The intelligent recommender system exploits knowledge, learns, discovers new information, infers preferences and criticisms, among other things. For that, the framework of an intelligent recommender system is defined by the following components: knowledge representation paradigm, learning methods, and reasoning mechanisms. Additionally, it has five knowledge models about the different aspects that we can consider during a recommendation: users, items, domain, context and criticisms. The mix of the components exploits the knowledge, updates it and infers, among other things. In this work, we implement one intelligent recommender system based on this framework, using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). Next, we test the performance of the intelligent recommender system with specialized criteria linked to the utilization of the knowledge in order to test the versatility and performance of the framework."

As such, the learned embeddings underutilize the two kinds of pivotal information and are insufficient to effectively represent the latent semantics of users and items in vector space."

    "abstract": "In this article we review the existing techniques in group recommender systems and we propose some improvement based on the study of the different individual behaviors when carrying out a decision-making process. Our method includes an analysis of group personality composition and trust between each group member to improve the accuracy of group recommenders. This way we simulate the argumentation process followed by groups of people when agreeing on a common activity in a more realistic way. Moreover, we reflect how they expect the system to behave in a long term recommendation process. This is achieved by including a memory of past recommendations that increases the satisfaction of users whose preferences have not been taken into account in previous recommendations."

    "abstract": "This experimental study (N = 107) aims at investigating how the \u201cmost-viewed\u201d recommendation features of online news affect users' news story choices, by employing an unobtrusive measurement for news exposure. The major findings clearly support the thesis that the presence of recommendations influences users' selection of news stories. First, the participants' self-reported assessment of the reasons for their story choices indicates that the incorporation of recommendations heightened their awareness of formal salience features. Second, these recommendations decreased the time for website exploration, and therefore increased the time available for reading news articles. Third, when the recommender system was available, approximately 50% of the participants' total story exposures came through the recommendation features. Fourth, those participants who were in the recommendation condition selected a larger number of the most-viewed stories featured in the recommender system than their counterparts in the no-recommendation condition; and a majority (about 80%) of the former group's access to those most-viewed stories was via the recommender system, in terms of either number or time. Last, the mean exposure time per recommended story did not differ across either recommendation conditions (with vs. without) or access routes (recommender system vs. front/topical sections)."

    "title": "DeepReco: Deep Learning Based Health Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "In today\u2019s digital world healthcare is one core area of the medical domain. A healthcare system is required to analyze a large amount of patient data which helps to derive insights and assist the prediction of diseases. This system should be intelligent in order to predict a health condition by analyzing a patient\u2019s lifestyle, physical health records and social activities. The health recommender system (HRS) is becoming an important platform for healthcare services. In this context, health intelligent systems have become indispensable tools in decision making processes in the healthcare sector. Their main objective is to ensure the availability of the valuable information at the right time by ensuring information quality, trustworthiness, authentication and privacy concerns. As people use social networks to understand their health condition, so the health recommender system is very important to derive outcomes such as recommending diagnoses, health insurance, clinical pathway-based treatment methods and alternative medicines based on the patient\u2019s health profile. Recent research which targets the utilization of large volumes of medical data while combining multimodal data from disparate sources is discussed which reduces the workload and cost in health care. In the healthcare sector, big data analytics using recommender systems have an important role in terms of decision-making processes with respect to a patient\u2019s health. This paper gives a proposed intelligent HRS using Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning method, which provides an insight into how big data analytics can be used for the implementation of an effective health recommender engine, and illustrates an opportunity for the health care industry to transition from a traditional scenario to a more personalized paradigm in a tele-health environment. By considering Root Square Mean Error (RSME) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, the proposed deep learning method (RBM-CNN) presents fewer errors compared to other approaches."

    "title": "Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation methods play a crucial role in modern recommender systems because of their ability to capture a user's dynamic interest from her/his historical interactions. Despite their success, we argue that these approaches usually rely on the sequential prediction task to optimize the huge amounts of parameters. They usually suffer from the data sparsity problem, which makes it difficult for them to learn high-quality user representations. To tackle that, inspired by recent advances of contrastive learning techniques in the computer version, we propose a novel multi-task model called \\textbf{C}ontrastive \\textbf{L}earning for \\textbf{S}equential \\textbf{Rec}ommendation~(\\textbf{CL4SRec}). CL4SRec not only takes advantage of the traditional next item prediction task but also utilizes the contrastive learning framework to derive self-supervision signals from the original user behavior sequences. Therefore, it can extract more meaningful user patterns and further encode the user representation effectively. In addition, we propose three data augmentation approaches to construct self-supervision signals. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that CL4SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines by inferring better user representations."

    "title": "Matrix Factorization with Explicit Trust and Distrust Side Information for Improved Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "With the advent of online social networks, recommender systems have became crucial for the success of many online applications/services due to their significance role in tailoring these applications to user-specific needs or preferences. Despite their increasing popularity, in general, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity and cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with the rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting trust information in the recommendation process stems from the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user communities, in addition to trust relations, distrust relations also exist between users. For instance, in Epinions, the concepts of personal \u201cweb of trust\u201d and personal \u201cblock list\u201d allow users to categorize their friends based on the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. Hence, it will be interesting to incorporate this new source of information in recommendation as well. In contrast to the incorporation of trust information in recommendation which is thriving, the potential of explicitly incorporating distrust relations is almost unexplored. In this article, we propose a matrix factorization-based model for recommendation in social rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust relationships aiming to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the data sparsity and cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the Epinions dataset, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard trust-enhanced or distrust-enhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy, thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit distrust information can have on recommender systems."

    "title": "Meta-recommendation systems",
    "abstract": "In a world where the number of choices can be overwhelming, recommender systems help users find and evaluate items of interest. They do so by connecting users with information regarding the content of recommended items or the opinions of other individuals. Such systems have become powerful tools in domains such as electronic commerce, digital libraries, and knowledge management. In this paper, we address such systems and introduce a new class of recommender system called meta-recommenders. Meta-recommenders provide users with personalized control over the generation of a single recommendation list formed from a combination of rich data using multiple information sources and recommendation techniques. We discuss experiments conducted to aid in the design of interfaces for a meta-recommender in the domain of movies. We demonstrate that meta-recommendations fill a gap in the current design of recommender systems. Finally, we consider the challenges of building real-world, usable meta-recommenders across a variety of domains."

    "title": "DropoutNet: Addressing Cold Start in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Latent models have become the default choice for recommender systems due to their performance and scalability. However, research in this area has primarily focused on modeling user-item interactions, and few latent models have been developed for cold start. Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable success showing excellent results for diverse input types. Inspired by these results we propose a neural network based latent model called DropoutNet to address the cold start problem in recommender systems. Unlike existing approaches that incorporate additional content-based objective terms, we instead focus on the optimization and show that neural network models can be explicitly trained for cold start through dropout. Our model can be applied on top of any existing latent model effectively providing cold start capabilities, and full power of deep architectures. Empirically we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on publicly available benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/DropoutNet."

    "title": "European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation (EuroSCORE)",
    "abstract": "Objective: To construct a scoring system for the prediction of early mortality in cardiac surgical patients in Europe on the basis of objective risk factors. Methods: The EuroSCORE database was divided into developmental and validation subsets. In the former, risk factors deemed to be objective, credible, obtainable and difficult to falsify were weighted on the basis of regression analysis. An additive score of predicted mortality was constructed. Its calibration and discrimination characteristics were assessed in the validation dataset. Thresholds were defined to distinguish low, moderate and high risk groups. Results: The developmental dataset had 13 302 patients, calibration by Hosmer Lemeshow Chi square was (8)=8.26 (P<0.40) and discrimination by area under ROC curve was 0.79. The validation dataset had 1479 patients, calibration Chi square (10)=7.5, P<0.68 and the area under the ROC curve was 0.76. The scoring system identified three groups of risk factors with their weights (additive % predicted mortality) in brackets. Patient-related factors were age over 60 (one per 5 years or part thereof), female (1), chronic pulmonary disease (1), extracardiac arteriopathy (2), neurological dysfunction (2), previous cardiac surgery (3), serum creatinine >200 \u03bcmol/l (2), active endocarditis (3) and critical preoperative state (3). Cardiac factors were unstable angina on intravenous nitrates (2), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (30\u201350%: 1, <30%: 3), recent (<90 days) myocardial infarction (2) and pulmonary systolic pressure >60 mmHg (2). Operation-related factors were emergency (2), other than isolated coronary surgery (2), thoracic aorta surgery (3) and surgery for postinfarct septal rupture (4). The scoring system was then applied to three risk groups. The low risk group (EuroSCORE 1-2) had 4529 patients with 36 deaths (0.8%), 95% confidence limits for observed mortality (0.56\u20131.10) and for expected mortality (1.27\u20131.29). The medium risk group (EuroSCORE 3\u20135) had 5977 patients with 182 deaths (3%), observed mortality (2.62\u20133.51), predicted (2.90\u20132.94). The high risk group (EuroSCORE 6 plus) had 4293 patients with 480 deaths (11.2%) observed mortality (10.25\u201312.16), predicted (10.93\u201311.54). Overall, there were 698 deaths in 14 799 patients (4.7%), observed mortality (4.37\u20135.06), predicted (4.72\u20134.95). Conclusion: EuroSCORE is a simple, objective and up-to-date system for assessing heart surgery, soundly based on one of the largest, most complete and accurate databases in European cardiac surgical history. We recommend its widespread use."

We aim to identify the involved methodological design alternatives, and their effect on the resulting measurements, with a view to assessing their suitability, advantages, and potential shortcomings. We compare five experimental methodologies, broadly covering the variants reported in the literature. In our experiments with three state-of-the-art recommenders, four of the evaluation methodologies are consistent with each other and differ from error metrics, in terms of the comparative recommenders' performance measurements. The other procedure aligns with RMSE, but shows a heavy bias towards known relevant items, considerably overestimating performance."

    "title": "Geometric Matrix Completion with Recurrent Multi-Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Matrix completion models are among the most common formulations of recommender systems. Recent works have showed a boost of performance of these techniques when introducing the pairwise relationships between users/items in the form of graphs, and imposing smoothness priors on these graphs. However, such techniques do not fully exploit the local stationarity structures of user/item graphs, and the number of parameters to learn is linear w.r.t. the number of users and items. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations by using geometric deep learning on graphs. Our matrix completion architecture combines graph convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn meaningful statistical graph-structured patterns and the non-linear diffusion process that generates the known ratings. This neural network system requires a constant number of parameters independent of the matrix size. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques."

In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results."

    "title": "Introducing Serendipity in a Content-Based Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Today recommenders are commonly used with various purposes, especially dealing with e-commerce and information filtering tools. Content-based recommenders rely on the concept of similarity between the bought/ searched/ visited item and all the items stored in a repository. It is a common belief that the user is interested in what is similar to what she has already bought/searched/visited. We believe that there are some contexts in which this assumption is wrong: it is the case of acquiring unsearched but still useful items or pieces of information. This is called serendipity. Our purpose is to stimulate users and facilitate these serendipitous encounters to happen. This paper presents the design and implementation of a hybrid recommender system that joins a content-based approach and serendipitous heuristics in order to mitigate the over-specialization problem with surprising suggestions."

Most recommender systems researches have been focused on the accuracy improvement of recommendation algorithms. Choosing appropriate similarity measure is a key to the recommender system success for this target. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is one of the most popular similarity measures for Collaborative filtering recommender system, to evaluate how much two users are correlated. While Correlation-based prediction schemes were shown to perform well, they suffer from some limitations. In This paper we present an extension toward Pearson Correlation Coefficient measure for cases which does not exist similarity between users by using it. Experimental result on the film trust data set demonstrate via our proposed measure and PCC we can achieve better result for similarity measure than traditional PCC."

    "title": "Learning Image and User Features for Recommendation in Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Good representations of data do help in many machine learning tasks such as recommendation. It is often a great challenge for traditional recommender systems to learn representative features of both users and images in large social networks, in particular, social curation networks, which are characterized as the extremely sparse links between users and images, and the extremely diverse visual contents of images. To address the challenges, we propose a novel deep model which learns the unified feature representations for both users and images. This is done by transforming the heterogeneous user-image networks into homogeneous low-dimensional representations, which facilitate a recommender to trivially recommend images to users by feature similarity. We also develop a fast online algorithm that can be easily scaled up to large networks in an asynchronously parallel way. We conduct extensive experiments on a representative subset of Pinterest, containing 1,456,540 images and 1,000,000 users. Results of image recommendation experiments demonstrate that our feature learning approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art recommendation methods."

However, as the recommendation tasks are diverse and various in the real world, it is quite challenging to design proper GNN methods for specific problems. In this tutorial, we focus on the critical challenges of GNN-based recommendation and the potential solutions. Specifically, we start from an extensive background of recommender systems and graph neural networks. Then we fully discuss why GNNs are required in recommender systems and the four parts of challenges, including graph construction, network design, optimization, and computation efficiency. Then, we discuss how to address these challenges by elaborating on the recent advances of GNN-based recommendation models, with a systematic taxonomy from four critical perspectives: stages, scenarios, objectives, and applications. Last, we finalize this tutorial with conclusions and discuss important future directions."

    "abstract": "Exponential growth of information generated by online social networks demands effective recommender systems to give useful results. Traditional techniques become unqualified because they ignore social relation data; existing social recommendation approaches consider social network structure, but social context has not been fully considered. It is significant and challenging to fuse social contextual factors which are derived from users' motivation of social behaviors into social recommendation. In this paper, we investigate social recommendation on the basis of psychology and sociology studies, which exhibit two important factors: individual preference and interpersonal influence. We first present the particular importance of these two factors in online item adoption and recommendation. Then we propose a novel probabilistic matrix factorization method to fuse them in latent spaces. We conduct experiments on both Facebook style bidirectional and Twitter style unidirectional social network datasets in China. The empirical result and analysis on these two large datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperform the existing approaches."

IntroductionAlthough considerable improvement has occurred in the process of care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), room for improvement exists.1\u20133 The purpose of the present guideline is to focus on the numerous advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with STEMI since 1999. This is reflected in the changed name of the guideline: \"ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.\" The final recommendations for indications for a diagnostic procedure, a particular therapy, or an intervention in patients with STEMI summarize both clinical evidence and expert opinion (Table 1). To provide clinicians with a set of recommendations that can easily be translated into the practice of caring for patients with STEMI, this guideline is organized around the chronology of the interface between the patient and the clinician. The full guideline is available at http://www.acc.org/clinical/guidelines/stemi/index.htm. TABLE 1.

PathologyA. EpidemiologySTEMI continues to be a significant public health problem in industrialized countries and is becoming an increasingly significant problem in developing countries.4 Although the exact incidence is difficult to ascertain, using first-listed and secondary hospital discharge data, there were 1 680 000 unique discharges for ACS in 2001.5 Applying the conservative estimate of 30% of the ACS patients who have STEMI from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction-4 [NRMI-4],5a we estimate 500 000 STEMI events per year in the U.S. This writing committee strongly endorses several public health campaigns that are likely to contribute to a reduction in the incidence of and fatality from STEMI in the future and additional research of new strategies for the management of STEMI patients in the community.6\u201313III. Management Before STEMIA. Identification of Patients at Risk of STEMIClass IPrimary care providers should evaluate the presence and status of control of major risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) for all patients at regular intervals (approximately every 3 to 5 years). (Level of Evidence: C)Ten-year risk (National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] global risk) of developing symptomatic CHD should be calculated for all patients who have 2 or more major risk factors to assess the need for primary prevention strategies.14(Level of Evidence: B)Patients with established CHD should be identified for secondary prevention, and patients with a CHD risk equivalent (eg, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or 10-year risk greater than 20% as calculated by Framingham equations) should receive equally intensive risk factor intervention as those with clinically apparent CHD. (Level of Evidence: A)B. Patient Education for Early Recognition and Response to STEMIClass I1. Patients with symptoms of STEMI (chest discomfort with or without radiation to the arms[s], back, neck, jaw, or epigastrium; shortness of breath; weakness; diaphoresis; nausea; lightheadedness) should be transported to the hospital by ambulance rather than by friends or relatives. (Level of Evidence: B)2. Healthcare providers should actively address the following issues regarding STEMI with patients and their families:a. The patient's heart attack risk (Level of Evidence: C)b. How to recognize symptoms of STEMI (Level of Evidence: C)c. The advisability of calling 9-1-1 if symptoms are unimproved or worsening after 5 minutes, despite feelings of uncertainty about the symptoms and fear of potential embarrassment (Level of Evidence: C)d. A plan for appropriate recognition and response to a potential acute cardiac event that includes the phone number to access emergency medical services (EMS), generally 9-1-1.15(Level of Evidence: C)3. Healthcare providers should instruct patients for whom nitroglycerin has been prescribed previously to take ONE nitroglycerin dose sublingually in response to chest discomfort/pain. If chest discomfort/pain is unimproved or worsening 5 minutes after 1 sublingual nitroglycerin dose has been taken, it is recommended that the patient or family member/friend call 9-1-1 immediately to access EMS. (Level of Evidence: C)Morbidity and mortality due to STEMI can be reduced significantly if patients and bystanders recognize symptoms early, activate the EMS system, and thereby shorten the time to definitive treatment. Patients with possible symptoms of STEMI should be transported to the hospital by ambulance rather than by friends or relatives because there is a significant association between arrival at the emergency department (ED) by ambulance and early reperfusion therapy.16\u201319 Although the traditional recommendation is for patients to take 1 nitroglycerin dose sublingually, 5 minutes apart, for up to 3 doses before calling for emergency evaluation, this recommendation has been modified by the writing committee to encourage earlier contacting of EMS by patients with symptoms suggestive of STEMI.20,21IV. Onset of STEMIA. Out-of-Hospital Cardiac ArrestClass IAll communities should create and maintain a strong \"Chain of Survival\" for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that includes early access (recognition of the problem and activation of the EMS system by a bystander), early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation for patients who need it, and early advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). (Level of Evidence: C)Family members of patients experiencing STEMI should be advised to take CPR training and familiarize themselves with the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). In addition, they should be referred to a CPR training program that has a social support component for family members of post-STEMI patients. (Level of Evidence: B)The links in the chain include early access (recognition of the problem and activation of the EMS system by a bystander), early CPR, early defibrillation for patients who need it, and early ACLS.V. Prehospital IssuesA. Emergency Medical Services SystemsClass IAll EMS first responders who respond to patients with chest pain and/or suspected cardiac arrest should be trained and equipped to provide early defibrillation. (Level of Evidence: A)All public safety first responders who respond to patients with chest pain and/or suspected cardiac arrest should be trained and equipped to provide early defibrillation with AEDs. (Provision of early defibrillation with AEDs by nonpublic safety first responders is a promising new strategy, but further study is needed to determine its safety and efficacy.) (Level of Evidence: B)Dispatchers staffing 9-1-1 center emergency medical calls should have medical training, should use nationally developed and maintained protocols, and should have a quality-improvement system in place to ensure compliance with protocols. (Level of Evidence: C)Early access to EMS is promoted by a 9-1-1 system currently available to more than 90% of the US population. To minimize time to treatment, particularly for cardiopulmonary arrest, many communities allow volunteer and/or paid firefighters and other first-aid providers to function as first responders, providing CPR and, increasingly, early defibrillation using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) until emergency medical technicians and paramedics arrive. Most cities and larger suburban areas provide EMS ambulance services with providers from the fire department, a private ambulance company, and/or volunteers.B. Prehospital Chest Pain Evaluation and TreatmentClass IPrehospital EMS providers should administer 162 to 325 mg of aspirin (chewed) to chest pain patients suspected of having STEMI unless contraindicated or already taken by patient. Although some trials have used enteric-coated aspirin for initial dosing, more rapid buccal absorption occurs with non\u2013enteric-coated formulations. (Level of Evidence: C)Class IIaIt is reasonable for all 9-1-1 dispatchers to advise patients without a history of aspirin allergy who have symptoms of STEMI to chew aspirin (162 to 325 mg) while awaiting arrival of prehospital EMS providers. Although some trials have used enteric-coated aspirin for initial dosing, more rapid buccal absorption occurs with non\u2013enteric-coated formulations. (Level of Evidence: C)It is reasonable that all ACLS providers perform and evaluate 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) routinely on chest pain patients suspected of STEMI. (Level of Evidence: B)If the ECG shows evidence of STEMI, it is reasonable that prehospital ACLS providers review a reperfusion \"checklist\" and relay the ECG and checklist findings to a predetermined medical control facility and/or receiving hospital. (Level of Evidence: C)It is reasonable for physicians to encourage the prehospital administration of aspirin via EMS personnel (ie, EMS dispatchers and providers) in patients with symptoms suggestive of STEMI unless its use is contraindicated.22 For patients who have ECG evidence of STEMI, it is reasonable that paramedics review a reperfusion checklist and relay the ECG and checklist findings to a predetermined medical control facility and/or receiving hospital.C. Prehospital FibrinolysisClass IIaEstablishment of a prehospital fibrinolysis protocol is reasonable in 1) settings in which physicians are present in the ambulance or in 2) well-organized EMS systems with full-time paramedics who have 12-lead ECGs in the field with transmission capability, paramedic initial and ongoing training in ECG interpretation and STEMI treatment, online medical command, a medical director with training/experience in STEMI management, and an ongoing continuous quality-improvement program. (Level of Evidence: B)Randomized controlled trials of fibrinolytic therapy have demonstrated the benefit of initiating fibrinolytic therapy as early as possible after onset of ischemic-type chest discomfort (Figure 1).23\u201325 It appears reasonable to expect that if fibrinolytic therapy could be started at the time of prehospital evaluation, a greater number of lives could be saved. Prehospital fibrinolysis is reasonable in those settings in which physicians are present in the ambulance or prehospital transport times are more than 60 minutes in high-volume (more than 25,000 runs per year) EMS systems.26 Other considerations for implementing a prehospital fibrinolytic service include the ability to transmit ECGs, paramedic initial and ongoing training in ECG interpretation and myocardial infarction (MI) treatment, online medical command, a medical director with training/experience in management of STEMI, and full-time paramedics.27Download figureDownload PowerPointFigure 1. Options for transportation of STEMI patients and initial reperfusion treatment. Panel A, Patient transported by EMS after calling 9-1-1: Reperfusion in patients with STEMI can be accomplished by the pharmacological (fibrinolysis) or catheter-based (primary PCI) approaches. Implementation of these strategies varies based on the mode of transportation of the patient and capabilities at the receiving hospital. Transport time to the hospital is variable from case to case, but the goal is to keep total ischemic time within 120 minutes. There are 3 possibilities: (1) If EMS has fibrinolytic capability and the patient qualifies for therapy, prehospital fibrinolysis should be started within 30 minutes of EMS arrival on scene. (2) If EMS is not capable of administering prehospital fibrinolysis and the patient is transported to a non\u2013PCI-capable hospital, the hospital door-to-needle time should be within 30 minutes for patients in whom fibrinolysis is indicated. (3) If EMS is not capable of administering prehospital fibrinolysis and the patient is transported to a PCI-capable hospital, the hospital door-to-balloon time should be within 90 minutes. Interhospital transfer: It is also appropriate to consider emergency interhospital transfer of the patient to a PCI-capable hospital for mechanical revascularization if (1) there is a contraindication to fibrinolysis; (2) PCI can be initiated promptly (within 90 minutes after the patient presented to the initial receiving hospital or within 60 minutes compared to when fibrinolysis with a fibrin-specific agent could be initiated at the initial receiving hospital); or (3) fibrinolysis is administered and is unsuccessful (ie, \"rescue PCI\"). Secondary nonemergency interhospital transfer can be considered for recurrent ischemia. Patient self-transport: Patient self-transportation is discouraged. If the patient arrives at a non\u2013PCI-capable hospital, the door-to-needle time should be within 30 minutes. If the patient arrives at a PCI-capable hospital, the door-to-balloon time should be within 90 minutes. The treatment options and time recommendations after first hospital arrival are the same. Panel B, For patients who receive fibrinolysis, noninvasive risk stratification is recommended to identify the need for rescue PCI (failed fibrinolysis) or ischemia-driven PCI. See Sections 6.3.1.6.4.5. and 6.3.1.6.7. in the full-text guidelines. Regardless of the initial method of reperfusion treatment, all patients should receive late hospital care and secondary prevention of STEMI. EMS indicates Emergency Medical System; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft surgery; Hosp, hospital; Noninv., Noninvasive. * Golden hour = First 60 minutes;\u2020 The medical system goal is to facilitate rapid recognition and treatment of patients with STEMI such that door-to-needle (or medical contact\u2013to-needle) time for initiation of fibrinolytic therapy is within 30 minutes or that door-to-balloon (or medical contact\u2013to-balloon) time for PCI is within 90 minutes. These goals should not be understood as ideal times but rather as the longest times that should be considered acceptable for a given system. Systems that are able to achieve even more rapid times for treatment of patients with STEMI should be encouraged. Modified with permission from Armstrong et al. Circulation. 2003;107:2533\u20137.25D. Prehospital Destination ProtocolsClass IPatients with STEMI who have cardiogenic shock and are less than 75 years of age should be brought immediately or secondarily transferred to facilities capable of cardiac catheterization and rapid revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]) if it can be performed within 18 hours of onset of shock. (Level of Evidence: A)Patients with STEMI who have contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy should be brought immediately or secondarily transferred promptly (ie, primary-receiving hospital door-to-departure time less than 30 minutes) to facilities capable of cardiac catheterization and rapid revascularization (PCI or CABG). (Level of Evidence: B)Every community should have a written protocol that guides EMS system personnel in determining where to take patients with suspected or confirmed STEMI. (Level of Evidence: C)Class IIaIt is reasonable that patients with STEMI who have cardiogenic shock and are 75 years of age or older be considered for immediate or prompt secondary transfer to facilities capable of cardiac catheterization and rapid revascularization (PCI or CABG) if it can be performed within 18 hours of onset of shock. (Level of Evidence: B)It is reasonable that patients with STEMI who are at especially high risk of dying, including those with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), be considered for immediate or prompt secondary transfer (ie, primary-receiving hospital door-to-departure time less than 30 minutes) to facilities capable of cardiac catheterization and rapid revascularization (PCI or CABG). (Level of Evidence: B)Every community should have a written protocol that guides EMS system personnel in determining where to take patients with suspected or confirmed STEMI. Active involvement of local healthcare providers, particularly cardiologists and emergency physicians, is needed to formulate local EMS destination protocols for these patients. In general, patients with suspected STEMI should be taken to the nearest appropriate hospital. However, patients with STEMI and shock are an exception to this general rule. Whenever possible, STEMI patients less than 75 years of age with shock should be transferred to facilities capable of cardiac catheterization and rapid revascularization (PCI or CABG). On the basis of observations in the SHOCK Trial Registry and other registries, it is reasonable to extend such considerations of transfer to invasive centers for elderly patients with shock (see VII.F.5 and Section 7.6.5 of the full-text guidelines). Patients with STEMI who have contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy should be brought immediately or secondarily transferred promptly (ie, primary-receiving hospital door-to-departure time less than 30 minutes) to facilities capable of cardiac catheterization and rapid revascularization (PCI or CABG).VI. Initial Recognition and Management in the Emergency DepartmentA. Optimal Strategies for Emergency Department TriageClass IHospitals should establish multidisciplinary teams (including primary care physicians, emergency medicine physicians, cardiologists, nurses, and laboratorians) to develop guideline-based, institution-specific written protocols for triaging and managing patients who are seen in the prehospital setting or present to the ED with symptoms suggestive of STEMI. (Level of Evidence: B)B. Initial Patient EvaluationClass IThe delay from patient contact with the healthcare system (typically, arrival at the ED or contact with paramedics) to initiation of fibrinolytic therapy should be less than 30 minutes. Alternatively, if PCI is chosen, the delay from patient contact with the healthcare system (typically, arrival at the ED or contact with paramedics) to balloon inflation should be less than 90 minutes. (Level of Evidence: B)The choice of initial STEMI treatment should be made by the emergency medicine physician on duty based on a predetermined, institution-specific, written protocol that is a collaborative effort of cardiologists (both those involved in coronary care unit management and interventionalists), emergency physicians, primary care physicians, nurses, and other appropriate personnel. For cases in which the initial diagnosis and treatment plan is unclear to the emergency physician or is not covered directly by the agreed-on protocol, immediate cardiology consultation is advisable. (Level of Evidence: C)Regardless of the approach used, all patients presenting to the ED with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of STEMI or unstable angina should be considered high-priority triage cases and should be evaluated and treated based on a predetermined, institution-specific chest pain protocol.

    "title": "Beyond Bibliometrics",
    "abstract": "The rate at which scholarly literature is being produced has been increasing at approximately 3.5 percent per year for decades. This means that during a typical 40 year career the amount of new literature produced each year increases by a factor of four. The methods scholars use to discover relevant literature must change. Just like everybody else involved in information discovery, scholars are confronted with information overload. Two decades ago, this discovery process essentially consisted of paging through abstract books, talking to colleagues and librarians, and browsing journals. A time-consuming process, which could even be longer if material had to be shipped from elsewhere. Now much of this discovery process is mediated by online scholarly information systems. All these systems are relatively new, and all are still changing. They all share a common goal: to provide their users with access to the literature relevant to their specific needs. To achieve this each system responds to actions by the user by displaying articles which the system judges relevant to the user's current needs. Recently search systems which use particularly sophisticated methodologies to recommend a few specific papers to the user have been called \"recommender systems\". These methods are in line with the current use of the term \"recommender system\" in computer science. We do not adopt this definition, rather we view systems like these as components in a larger whole, which is presented by the scholarly information systems themselves. In what follows we view the recommender system as an aspect of the entire information system; one which combines the massive memory capacities of the machine with the cognitive abilities of the human user to achieve a human-machine synergy."

    "title": "Towards Long-term Fairness in Recommendation",
    "abstract": "As Recommender Systems (RS) influence more and more people in their daily life, the issue of fairness in recommendation is becoming more and more important. Most of the prior approaches to fairness-aware recommendation have been situated in a static or one-shot setting, where the protected groups of items are fixed, and the model provides a one-time fairness solution based on fairness-constrained optimization. This fails to consider the dynamic nature of the recommender systems, where attributes such as item popularity may change over time due to the recommendation policy and user engagement. For example, products that were once popular may become no longer popular, and vice versa. As a result, the system that aims to maintain long-term fairness on the item exposure in different popularity groups must accommodate this change in a timely fashion."

However, not all parts of the reviews are equally important, and the same choice of words may reflect a different meaning based on its context. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Aspect-based Neural Recommender (ANR) to perform aspect-based representation learning for both users and items via an attention-based component. Furthermore, we model the multi-faceted process behind how users rate items by estimating the aspect-level user and item importance by adapting the neural co-attention mechanism. Our proposed model concurrently address several shortcomings of existing recommender systems, and a thorough experimental study on 25 benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp shows that ANR significantly outperforms recently proposed state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCoNN, D-Attn and ALFM."

According to literature study on this problem, the solutions can be classified into two classes based on the nature of collecting missing information: (1) explicit solutions and (ii) implicit solutions.

    "abstract": "Two-sided marketplaces are platforms that have customers not only on the demand side (e.g. users), but also on the supply side (e.g. retailer, artists). While traditional recommender systems focused specifically towards increasing consumer satisfaction by providing relevant content to consumers, two-sided marketplaces face the problem of additionally optimizing for supplier preferences, and visibility. Indeed, the suppliers would want afair opportunity to be presented to users. Blindly optimizing for consumer relevance may have a detrimental impact on supplier fairness. Motivated by this problem, we focus on the trade-off between objectives of consumers and suppliers in the case of music streaming services, and consider the trade-off betweenrelevance of recommendations to the consumer (i.e. user) andfairness of representation of suppliers (i.e. artists) and measure their impact on consumersatisfaction."

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of these guidelines is to assist physicians in recommending, performing, interpreting and reporting the results of FDG PET/CT for oncological imaging of adult patients. PET is a quantitative imaging technique and therefore requires a common quality control (QC)/quality assurance (QA) procedure to maintain the accuracy and precision of quantitation. Repeatability and reproducibility are two essential requirements for any quantitative measurement and/or imaging biomarker. Repeatability relates to the uncertainty in obtaining the same result in the same patient when he or she is examined more than once on the same system. However, imaging biomarkers should also have adequate reproducibility, i.e. the ability to yield the same result in the same patient when that patient is examined on different systems and at different imaging sites. Adequate repeatability and reproducibility are essential for the clinical management of patients and the use of FDG PET/CT within multicentre trials. A common standardised imaging procedure will help promote the appropriate use of FDG PET/CT imaging and increase the value of publications and, therefore, their contribution to evidence-based medicine. Moreover, consistency in numerical values between platforms and institutes that acquire the data will potentially enhance the role of semiquantitative and quantitative image interpretation. Precision and accuracy are additionally important as FDG PET/CT is used to evaluate tumour response as well as for diagnosis, prognosis and staging. Therefore both the previous and these new guidelines specifically aim to achieve standardised uptake value harmonisation in multicentre settings."

    "title": "Knowledge Based Recommender Systems Using Explicit User Models",
    "abstract": "While recommender systems are in widespread use, they still experience problems. Many recommender systems produce recommendations which the customers find unsatisfactory. Further, these systems often suffer from problems when there are not enough participants, or when new products enter the system. We perceive an opportunity for knowledge-based recommender systems to gain leverage on recommendation tasks by using explicit models of both the user of the system and the products being recommeded. This differs from previous systems which, when they use a user model, have used one that is inferred from the given by that user (i.e., an implicit user model). We believe that the additional information given by the user and product models can give the system leverage in difficult recommendation tasks, and also alleviate both the early rater problem and the sparse ratings problem experienced by current recommender systems~"

    "title": "Interactive collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study collaborative filtering (CF) in an interactive setting, in which a recommender system continuously recommends items to individual users and receives interactive feedback. Whilst users enjoy sequential recommendations, the recommendation predictions are constantly refined using up-to-date feedback on the recommended items. Bringing the interactive mechanism back to the CF process is fundamental because the ultimate goal for a recommender system is about the discovery of interesting items for individual users and yet users' personal preferences and contexts evolve over time during the interactions with the system. This requires us not to distinguish between the stages of collecting information to construct the user profile and making recommendations, but to seamlessly integrate these stages together during the interactive process, with the goal of maximizing the overall recommendation accuracy throughout the interactions. This mechanism naturally addresses the cold-start problem as any user can immediately receive sequential recommendations without providing ratings beforehand. We formulate the interactive CF with the probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) framework, and leverage several exploitation-exploration algorithms to select items, including the empirical Thompson sampling and upper confidence bound based algorithms. We conduct our experiment on cold-start users as well as warm-start users with drifting taste. Results show that the proposed methods have significant improvements over several strong baselines for the MovieLens, EachMovie and Netflix datasets."

Especially, it provides more personalized recommendation when the assigned tags belong to more diverse topics. The proposed algorithm is particularly effective for small-degree objects, which reminds us of the well-known cold-start problem in recommender systems. Further empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm can significantly solve this problem in social tagging systems with heterogeneous object degree."

    "title": "Adversarial Training Towards Robust Multimedia Recommender System",
    "abstract": "With the prevalence of multimedia content on the Web, developing recommender solutions that can effectively leverage the rich signal in multimedia data is in urgent need. Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation learning, recent advances on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of multimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia recommendation. In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a small (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease the recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia recommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can lead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial learning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia recommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product recommendation. Extensive results verify the positive effect of adversarial learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of our AMR method. Source codes are available in https://github.com/duxy-me/AMR."

    "abstract": "Recommender system is one of the most popular data mining topics that keep drawing extensive attention from both academia and industry. Among them, POI (point of interest) recommendation is extremely practical but challenging: it greatly benefits both users and businesses in real-world life, but it is hard due to data scarcity and various context. While a number of algorithms attempt to tackle the problem w.r.t. specific data and problem settings, they often fail when the scenarios change. In this work, we propose to devise a general and principled SSL (semi-supervised learning) framework, to alleviate data scarcity via smoothing among neighboring users and POIs, and treat various context by regularizing user preference based on context graphs. To enable such a framework, we develop PACE (Preference And Context Embedding), a deep neural architecture that jointly learns the embeddings of users and POIs to predict both user preference over POIs and various context associated with users and POIs. We show that PACE successfully bridges CF (collaborative filtering) and SSL by generalizing the de facto methods matrix factorization of CF and graph Laplacian regularization of SSL. Extensive experiments on two real location-based social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PACE."

    "title": "Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization: Exploiting Graphs and Side Information",
    "abstract": "We propose a new matrix completion algorithm\u2014Kernelized Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (KPMF), which effectively incorporates external side information into the matrix factorization process. Unlike Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [14], which assumes an independent latent vector for each row (and each column) with Gaussian priors, KMPF works with latent vectors spanning all rows (and columns) with Gaussian Process (GP) priors. Hence, KPMF explicitly captures the underlying (nonlinear) covariance structures across rows and columns. This crucial difference greatly boosts the performance of KPMF when appropriate side information, e.g., users' social network in recommender systems, is incorporated. Furthermore, GP priors allow the KPMF model to fill in a row that is entirely missing in the original matrix based on the side information alone, which is not feasible for standard PMF formulation. In our paper, we mainly work on the matrix completion problem with a graph among the rows and/or columns as side information, but the proposed framework can be easily used with other types of side information as well. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of KPMF through two different applications: 1) recommender systems and 2) image restoration."

    "title": "Factorization Meets the Item Embedding",
    "abstract": "Matrix factorization (MF) models and their extensions are standard in modern recommender systems. MF models decompose the observed user-item interaction matrix into user and item latent factors. In this paper, we propose a co-factorization model, CoFactor, which jointly decomposes the user-item interaction matrix and the item-item co-occurrence matrix with shared item latent factors. For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix. We show that this model significantly improves the performance over MF models on several datasets with little additional computational overhead. We provide qualitative results that explain how CoFactor improves the quality of the inferred factors and characterize the circumstances where it provides the most significant improvements."

    "abstract": "There is increasing awareness in the Recommender Systems field that diversity is a key property that enhances the usefulness of recommendations. Genre information can serve as a means to measure and enhance the diversity of recommendations and is readily available in domains such as movies, music or books. In this work we propose a new Binomial framework for defining genre diversity in recommender systems that takes into account three key properties: genre coverage, genre redundancy and recommendation list size-awareness. We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity - including those adapted from search result diversification - fail to address adequately these three properties. We also propose an efficient greedy optimization technique to optimize Binomial diversity. Experiments with the Netflix dataset show the properties of our framework and comparison with state of the art methods."

Data streams present distinct properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of recommendation with stream inputs. In particular, we provide a principled framework termed sRec, which provides explicit continuous-time random process models of the creation of users and topics, and of the evolution of their interests. A variational Bayesian approach called recursive meanfield approximation is proposed, which permits computationally efficient instantaneous on-line inference. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our sRec over other state-of-the-arts."

    "title": "Machine Learning in Computer-Aided Synthesis Planning",
    "abstract": "ConspectusComputer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps. Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions, and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is advancing rapidly.In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published experimental data.Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines, not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving. While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure\u2013activity models in chemistry, it is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design. As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large."

    "title": "Preference Learning",
    "abstract": "The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in previous years. It involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. And, generalizing beyond training data, models thus learned may be used for preference prediction. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The first half of the book is organized into parts on label ranking, instance ranking, and object ranking; while the second half is organized into parts on applications of preference learning in multiattribute domains, information retrieval, and recommender systems. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research."

    "title": "Attentive Group Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Due to the prevalence of group activities in people's daily life, recommending content to a group of users becomes an important task in many information systems. A fundamental problem in group recommendation is how to aggregate the preferences of group members to infer the decision of a group. Toward this end, we contribute a novel solution, namely AGREE (short for ''Attentive Group REcommEndation''), to address the preference aggregation problem by learning the aggregation strategy from data, which is based on the recent developments of attention network and neural collaborative filtering (NCF). Specifically, we adopt an attention mechanism to adapt the representation of a group, and learn the interaction between groups and items from data under the NCF framework. Moreover, since many group recommender systems also have abundant interactions of individual users on items, we further integrate the modeling of user-item interactions into our method. Through this way, we can reinforce the two tasks of recommending items for both groups and users. By experimenting on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our AGREE model not only improves the group recommendation performance but also enhances the recommendation for users, especially for cold-start users that have no historical interactions individually."

    "abstract": "The cross-domain recommendation technique is an effective way of alleviating the data sparse issue in recommender systems by leveraging the knowledge from relevant domains. Transfer learning is a class of algorithms underlying these techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach for cross-domain recommendation by using neural networks as the base model. In contrast to the matrix factorization based cross-domain techniques, our method is deep transfer learning, which can learn complex user-item interaction relationships. We assume that hidden layers in two base networks are connected by cross mappings, leading to the collaborative cross networks (CoNet). CoNet enables dual knowledge transfer across domains by introducing cross connections from one base network to another and vice versa. CoNet is achieved in multi-layer feedforward networks by adding dual connections and joint loss functions, which can be trained efficiently by back-propagation. The proposed model is thoroughly evaluated on two large real-world datasets. It outperforms baselines by relative improvements of 7.84% in NDCG. We demonstrate the necessity of adaptively selecting representations to transfer. Our model can reduce tens of thousands training examples comparing with non-transfer methods and still has the competitive performance with them."

    "title": "Advances and challenges in conversational recommender systems: A survey",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems exploit interaction history to estimate user preference, having been heavily used in a wide range of industry applications. However, static recommendation models are difficult to answer two important questions well due to inherent shortcomings: (a) What exactly does a user like? (b) Why does a user like an item? The shortcomings are due to the way that static models learn user preference, i.e., without explicit instructions and active feedback from users. The recent rise of conversational recommender systems (CRSs) changes this situation fundamentally. In a CRS, users and the system can dynamically communicate through natural language interactions, which provide unprecedented opportunities to explicitly obtain the exact preference of users. Considerable efforts, spread across disparate settings and applications, have been put into developing CRSs. Existing models, technologies, and evaluation methods for CRSs are far from mature. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the techniques used in current CRSs. We summarize the key challenges of developing CRSs in five directions: (1) Question-based user preference elicitation. (2) Multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies. (3) Dialogue understanding and generation. (4) Exploitation-exploration trade-offs. (5) Evaluation and user simulation. These research directions involve multiple research fields like information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), and human-computer interaction (HCI). Based on these research directions, we discuss some future challenges and opportunities. We provide a road map for researchers from multiple communities to get started in this area. We hope this survey can help to identify and address challenges in CRSs and inspire future research."

So to make the Cloud services commercialized, Cloud markets are necessary and are being developed. As the increasing numbers of various Cloud services are rapidly evolving in the Cloud market, how to select the best and optimal services will be a great challenge. In this paper we present a Cloud service selection framework in the Cloud market that uses a recommender system (RS) which helps a user to select the best services from different Cloud providers (CP) that matches user requirements. The RS recommends a service based on the network QoS and Virtual Machine (VM) platform factors of difference CPs. The experimental results show that our Cloud service recommender system (CSRS) can effectively recommend a good combination of Cloud services to consumers."

We have implemented RECON, a reciprocal recommender for online dating, and have evaluated it on a large dataset from a major Australian dating website. We investigated the predictive power gained by taking account of reciprocity, finding that it is substantial, for example it improved the success rate of the top ten recommendations from 23% to 42% and also improved the recall at the same time. We also found reciprocity to help with the cold start problem obtaining a success rate of 26% for the top ten recommendations for new users. We discuss the implications of these results for broader uses of our approach for other reciprocal recommenders."

However, personalized recommendation, which considers the multiple needs of users and can make both accurate and diverse recommendations, is more suitable for modern recommender systems. In this paper, the task of personalized recommendation is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. A multiobjective recommendation model is proposed. The proposed model maximizes two conflicting performance metrics termed as accuracy and diversity. The accuracy is evaluated by the probabilistic spreading method, while the diversity is measured by recommendation coverage. The proposed MOEA-based recommendation method can simultaneously provide multiple recommendations for multiple users in only one run. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Comparison experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithm can make more diverse yet accurate recommendations."

To understand the aspects of music similarity that collaborative filtering can capture, we compare Genius to two canonical music recommender systems: one based purely on artist similarity, the other purely on similarity of acoustic content. We evaluate this comparison with a user study of 185 subjects. Overall, Genius produces the best recommendations. We demonstrate that collaborative filtering can actually capture similarities between the acoustic content of songs. However, when evaluators can see the names of the recommended songs and artists, we find that artist similarity can account for the performance of Genius. A system that combines these musical cues could generate music recommendations that are as good as Genius, even when collaborative filtering data is unavailable."

The objective is to compute prediction models that can be used to recommend whether a new bug should and will be fixed fast or will take more time for resolution. We examine in detail if attributes of a bug report can be used to build such a recommender system. We use decision tree analysis to compute and 10-fold cross validation to test prediction models. We explore prediction models in a series of empirical studies with bug report data of six systems of the three open source projects Eclipse, Mozilla, and Gnome. Results show that our models perform significantly better than random classification. For example, fast fixed Eclipse Platform bugs were classified correctly with a precision of 0.654 and a recall of 0.692. We also show that the inclusion of postsubmission bug report data of up to one month can further improve prediction models."

However, similar to traditional latent factor models by factorizing user-item interactions, they tend to be ineffective to capture localized information. Localized information, such as neighborhood, is important to recommender systems in complementing the user-item interaction data. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel Neighborhood-based Neural Collaborative Filtering model (NNCF). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the neighborhood information is integrated into the neural collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the implicit recommendation task."

Influence is a measure of the effect of a user on the recommendations from a recommender system. Influence is a powerful tool for understanding the workings of a recommender system. Experiments show that users have widely varying degrees of influence in ratings-based recommender systems. Proposed influence measures have been algorithm-specific, which limits their generality and comparability. We propose an algorithm-independent definition of influence that can be applied to any ratings-based recommender system.

    "abstract": "Performing accurate suggestions is an objective of paramount importance for effective recommender systems. Other important and increasingly evident objectives are novelty and diversity, which are achieved by recommender systems that are able to suggest diversified items not easily discovered by the users. Different recommendation algorithms have particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each of these objectives, motivating the construction of hybrid approaches. However, most of these approaches only focus on optimizing accuracy, with no regard for novelty and diversity. The problem of combining recommendation algorithms grows significantly harder when multiple objectives are considered simultaneously. For instance, devising multi-objective recommender systems that suggest items that are simultaneously accurate, novel and diversified may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, where the attempt to improve an objective further may result in worsening other competing objectives. In this paper we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines existing algorithms which differ in their level of accuracy, novelty and diversity. We employ an evolutionary search for hybrids following the Strength Pareto approach, which isolates hybrids that are not dominated by others (i.e., the so called Pareto frontier). Experimental results on two recommendation scenarios show that: (i) we can combine recommendation algorithms in order to improve an objective without significantly hurting other objectives, and (ii) we allow for adjusting the compromise between accuracy, diversity and novelty, so that the recommendation emphasis can be adjusted dynamically according to the needs of different users."

Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, the collaborative filtering (CF) scheme fails to leverage collaborative signals to infer user preference on these items. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to incorporate side information of items (e.g. content features) into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ modern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to discover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative representations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual dependencies between content features and collaborative representations and lack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory performance on cold-start recommendation."

Existing approaches for POI recommendation have been mainly focused on exploiting the information about user preferences, social influence, and geographical influence. However, these approaches cannot handle the scenario where users are expecting to have POI recommendation for a specific time period. To this end, in this paper, we propose a unified recommender system, named the 'Where and When to gO' (WWO) recommender system, to integrate the user interests and their evolving sequential preferences with temporal interval assessment. As a result, the WWO system can make recommendations dynamically for a specific time period and the traditional POI recommender system can be treated as the special case of the WWO system by setting this time period long enough. Specifically, to quantify users' sequential preferences, we consider the distributions of the temporal intervals between dependent POIs in the historical check-in sequences. Then, to estimate the distributions with only sparse observations, we develop the low-rank graph construction model, which identifies a set of bi-weighted graph bases so as to learn the static user preferences and the dynamic sequential preferences in a coherent way. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach using real-world data sets from several location-based social networks (LBSNs). The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for POI recommendation in terms of various metrics, such as F-measure and NDCG, with a significant margin."

Recently the idea of progressively querying user responses through an initial interview process has been proposed as a useful new user preference elicitation strategy. In this paper, we present functional matrix factorization (fMF), a novel cold-start recommendation method that solves the problem of initial interview construction within the context of learning user and item profiles. Specifically, fMF constructs a decision tree for the initial interview with each node being an interview question, enabling the recommender to query a user adaptively according to her prior responses. More importantly, we associate latent profiles for each node of the tree --- in effect restricting the latent profiles to be a function of possible answers to the interview questions --- which allows the profiles to be gradually refined through the interview process based on user responses. We develop an iterative optimization algorithm that alternates between decision tree construction and latent profiles extraction as well as a regularization scheme that takes into account of the tree structure. Experimental results on three benchmark recommendation data sets demonstrate that the proposed fMF algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods for cold-start recommendation."

However, we find that while implementing recommender systems does increase overall sales figures, it does not generally improve the relative sales for niche items, leading to a rich-get-richer situation. We find, across a wide range of product categories, that the use of traditional collaborative filters (CFs) is associated with a decrease in sales diversity relative to a world without product recommendations. The decrease in aggregate sales diversity may not always be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in individual-level consumption diversity. In fact, it is even possible for individual consumption diversity to increase as aggregate sales diversity decreases. CFs help individuals explore new products, but similar users still end up exploring the same kinds of products, resulting in concentration bias at the aggregate level. There is one insight for management: Traditional collaborative filters carry the unintended consequence of increasing concentration bias. A firm interested in exposing consumers to a broader assortment of products may prefer a different design from another simply interested in maximizing sales."

Generating recommendations in online services depends on privacy-sensitive data collected from the users. Traditional data protection mechanisms focus on access control and secure transmission, which provide security only against malicious third parties, but not the service provider. This creates a serious privacy risk for the users. In this paper, we aim to protect the private data against the service provider while preserving the functionality of the system. We propose encrypting private data and processing them under encryption to generate recommendations. By introducing a semitrusted third party and using data packing, we construct a highly efficient system that does not require the active participation of the user. We also present a comparison protocol, which is the first one to the best of our knowledge, that compares multiple values that are packed in one encryption. Conducted experiments show that this work opens a door to generate private recommendations in a privacy-preserving manner."

    "abstract": "The Web creates excellent opportunities for businesses to provide personalized online services to their customers. Recommender systems aim to automatically generate personalized suggestions of products/services to customers (businesses or individuals). Although recommender systems have been well studied, there are still two challenges in the development of a recommender system, particularly in real-world B2B e-services: (1) items or user profiles often present complicated tree structures in business applications, which cannot be handled by normal item similarity measures and (2) online users' preferences are often vague and fuzzy, and cannot be dealt with by existing recommendation methods. To handle both these challenges, this study first proposes a method for modeling fuzzy tree-structured user preferences, in which fuzzy set techniques are used to express user preferences. A recommendation approach to recommending tree-structured items is then developed. The key technique in this study is a comprehensive tree matching method, which can match two tree-structured data and identify their corresponding parts by considering all the information on tree structures, node attributes, and weights. Importantly, the proposed fuzzy preference tree-based recommendation approach is tested and validated using an Australian business dataset and the MovieLens dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy tree-structured user preference profile reflects user preferences effectively and the recommendation approach demonstrates excellent performance for tree-structured items, especially in e-business applications. This study also applies the proposed recommendation approach to the development of a Web-based business partner recommender system."

    "abstract": "Ranking is a core task in recommender systems, which aims at providing an ordered list of items to users. Typically, a ranking function is learned from the labeled dataset to optimize the global performance, which produces a ranking score for each individual item. However, it may be sub-optimal because the scoring function applies to each item individually and does not explicitly consider the mutual influence between items, as well as the differences of users' preferences or intents. Therefore, we propose a personalized re-ranking model for recommender systems. The proposed re-ranking model can be easily deployed as a follow-up modular after any ranking algorithm, by directly using the existing ranking feature vectors. It directly optimizes the whole recommendation list by employing a transformer structure to efficiently encode the information of all items in the list. Specifically, the Transformer applies a self-attention mechanism that directly models the global relationships between any pair of items in the whole list. We confirm that the performance can be further improved by introducing pre-trained embedding to learn personalized encoding functions for different users. Experimental results on both offline benchmarks and real-world online e-commerce systems demonstrate the significant improvements of the proposed re-ranking model."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are an integral part of the online retail environment. Prior research has focused largely on computational approaches to improving recommendation accuracy, and only recently researchers have started to study their behavioral implications and potential side effects. We used three controlled experiments, in the context of purchasing digital songs, to explore the willingness-to-pay judgments of individual consumers after being shown personalized recommendations. In Study 1, we found strong evidence that randomly assigned song recommendations affected participants\u2019 willingness to pay, even when controlling for participants\u2019 preferences and demographics. In Study 2, participants viewed actual system-generated recommendations that were intentionally perturbed (introducing recommendation error), and we observed similar effects. In Study 3, we showed that the influence of personalized recommendations on willingness-to-pay judgments was obtained even when preference uncertainty was reduced through immediate and mandatory song sampling prior to pricing. The results demonstrate the existence of important economic side effects of personalized recommender systems and inform our understanding of how system recommendations can influence our everyday preference judgments. The findings have significant implications for the design and application of recommender systems as well as for online retail practices.

    "title": "A Knowledge Based Recommender System with Multigranular Linguistic Information",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are applications that have emerged in the e-commerce area in order to assist users in their searches in electronic shops. These shops usually offer a wide range of items that cover the necessities of a great variety of users. Nevertheless, searching in such a wide range of items could be a very difficult and time-consuming task. Recommender systems assist users to find out suitable items by means of recommendations based on information provided by different sources such as: other users, experts, item features, etc. Most of the recommender systems force users to provide their preferences or necessities using an unique numerical scale of information fixed in advance. In spite of this information is usually related to opinions, tastes and perceptions, therefore, it seems that is usually better expressed in a qualitative way, with linguistic terms, than in a quantitative way, with precise numbers. We propose a Knowledge Based Recommender System that uses the fuzzy linguistic approach to define a flexible framework to capture the uncertainty of the user's preferences. Thus, this framework will allow users to express their necessities in scales closer to their own knowledge, and different from the scale utilized to describe the items."

    "title": "Link prediction in paper citation network to construct paper correlation graph",
    "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, recommender system has become one of the main tools to search for users\u2019 interested papers. Since one paper often contains only a part of keywords that a user is interested in, recommender system returns a set of papers that satisfy the user\u2019s need of keywords. Besides, to satisfy the users\u2019 requirements of further research on a certain domain, the recommended papers must be correlated. However, each paper of an existing paper citation network hardly has cited relationships with others, so the correlated links among papers are very sparse. In addition, while a mass of research approaches have been put forward in terms of link prediction to address the network sparsity problems, these approaches have no relationship with the effect of self-citations and the potential correlations among papers (i.e., these correlated relationships are not included in the paper citation network as their published time is close). Therefore, we propose a link prediction approach that combines time, keywords, and authors\u2019 information and optimizes the existing paper citation network. Finally, a number of experiments are performed on the real-world Hep-Th datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal and achieve good performance."

    "title": "TransNets",
    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is available. For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item, and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art performance on recommendation tasks. We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in recommendation, even when the target user's review for the target item is not available. Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item pair. We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another latent representation of the target user's review of the target item. We show that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous state-of-the-art."

    "title": "A Hybrid Collaborative Filtering Model with Deep Structure for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely used approach in recommender systems to solve many real-world problems. Traditional CF-based methods employ the user-item matrix which encodes the individual preferences of users for items for learning to make recommendation. In real applications, the rating matrix is usually very sparse, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in recommendation performance. In this case, some improved CF methods utilize the increasing amount of side information to address the data sparsity problem as well as the cold start problem. However, the learned latent factors may not be effective due to the sparse nature of the user-item matrix and the side information. To address this problem, we utilize advances of learning effective representations in deep learning, and propose a hybrid model which jointly performs deep users and items\u2019 latent factors learning from side information and collaborative filtering from the rating matrix. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our hybrid model outperforms other methods in effectively utilizing side information and achieves performance improvement."

    "title": "Social Choice Theory and Recommender Systems: Analysis of the Axiomatic Foundations of Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "The growth of Internet commerce has stimulated the use of collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms as recommender systems. Such systems leverage knowledge about the behavior of multiple users to recommend items of interest to individual users. CF methods have been harnessed to make recommendations about such items as web pages, movies, books, and toys. Researchers have proposed several variations of the technology. We take the perspective of CF as a methodology for combining preferences. The preferences predicted for the end user is some function of all of the known preferences for everyone in a database. Social Choice theorists, concerned with the properties of voting methods, have been investigating preference aggregation for decades. At the heart of this body of work is Arrow's result demonstrating the impossibility of combining preferences in a way that satisfies several desirable and innocuous-looking properties. We show that researchers working on CF algorithms often make similar assumptions. We elucidate these assumptions and extend results from Social Choice theory to CF methods. We show that only very restrictive CF functions are consistent with desirable aggregation properties. Finally, we discuss practical implications of these results."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems rely on the opinions of many users to predict the preferences of potential customers. These systems have been broadly used to make quality recommendations to increase sales. However, recommender systems are vulnerable to even small data inputs of malicious information. Inappropriate products can be offered to users by injecting a few unscrupulous \u201cshilling\u201d profiles into the recommender system. This research proposes to identify a cluster of profiles by focusing on \u201cfiller\u201d ratings. We examine a number of properties of such profiles, followed by empirical evidence and detailed analysis of various characteristics of the shilling attacks. We then propose a hybrid two-phase procedure for shilling attack detection. First, a multidimensional scaling approach is adopted to identify distinct behaviors that help to detect and secure the recommendation activities. Clustering-based methods are subsequently proposed to discriminate attack users. Experimental studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The 2011 STRAW + 10 reviewed advances in understanding of the critical changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function that occur before and after the final menstrual period.Scientists from five countries and multiple disciplines evaluated data from cohort studies of midlife women and in the context of chronic illness and endocrine disorders on change in menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers of reproductive aging including antim\u00fcllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count. Modifications were adopted by consensus.STRAW + 10 simplified bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage -3) and the early postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transition (Stage -1) and early postmenopause (Stage +1), and recommended application regardless of women's age, ethnicity, body size, or lifestyle characteristics.STRAW + 10 provides a more comprehensive basis for assessing reproductive aging in research and clinical contexts. Application of the STRAW + 10 staging system should improve comparability of studies of midlife women and facilitate clinical decision making. Nonetheless, important knowledge gaps persist, and seven research priorities are identified."

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Large Discrete Action Spaces",
    "abstract": "Being able to reason in an environment with a large number of discrete actions is essential to bringing reinforcement learning to a larger class of problems. Recommender systems, industrial plants and language models are only some of the many real-world tasks involving large numbers of discrete actions for which current methods are difficult or even often impossible to apply. An ability to generalize over the set of actions as well as sub-linear complexity relative to the size of the set are both necessary to handle such tasks. Current approaches are not able to provide both of these, which motivates the work in this paper. Our proposed approach leverages prior information about the actions to embed them in a continuous space upon which it can generalize. Additionally, approximate nearest-neighbor methods allow for logarithmic-time lookup complexity relative to the number of actions, which is necessary for time-wise tractable training. This combined approach allows reinforcement learning methods to be applied to large-scale learning problems previously intractable with current methods. We demonstrate our algorithm's abilities on a series of tasks having up to one million actions."

    "title": "Management of hepatocellular carcinoma: An update",
    "abstract": "Since the publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 2005, new information has emerged that requires that the guidelines be updated. The full version of the new guidelines is available on the AASLD Web site at http://www.aasld.org/practiceguidelines/Documents/Bookmarked%20Practice%20Guidelines/HCCUpdate2010.pdf. Here, we briefly describe only new or changed recommendations. AASLD, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; BCLC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma. In the previous guideline, groups were specified for which surveillance was likely to be cost-effective because the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence was high enough. New data on defining HCC risk have emerged for hepatitis B virus,1, 2 hepatitis C virus,3 and autoimmune hepatitis.4 Surveillance is deemed cost-effective if the expected HCC risk exceeds 1.5% per year in patients with hepatitis C and 0.2% per year in patients with hepatitis B. Analysis of recent studies show that alpha-fetoprotein determination lacks adequate sensitivity and specificity for effective surveillance (and for diagnosis).5, 6 Thus, surveillance has to be based on ultrasound examination. The recommended screening interval is 6 months. Diagnosis of HCC should be based on imaging techniques and/or biopsy.The 2005 diagnostic algorithm has been validated and the diagnostic accuracy of a single dynamic technique showing intense arterial uptake followed by \"washout\" of contrast in the venous-delayed phases has been demonstrated.7-9 Contrast-enhanced US may offer false positive HCC diagnosis in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and thus, has been dropped from the diagnostic techniques. The diagnostic algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. The application of dynamic imaging criteria should be applied only to patients with cirrhosis of any etiology and to patients with chronic hepatitis B who may not have fully developed cirrhosis or have regressed cirrhosis. Interpretation of biopsies and distinction between high-grade dysplatic nodules and HCC is challenging. Expert pathology diagnosis is reinforced by staining for glypican 3, heat shock protein 70, and glutamine synthetase, because positivity for two of these three stains confirms HCC.10 Diagnostic algorithm for suspected HCC. CT, computed tomography; MDCT, multidetector CT; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; US, ultrasound. The BCLC staging system (Fig. 2)11 has come to be widely accepted in clinical practice and is also being used for many clinical trials of new drugs to treat HCC. Therefore, it has become the de facto staging system that is used. The BCLC staging system for HCC. M, metastasis classification; N, node classification; PS, performance status; RFA, radiofrequency ablation; TACE, transarterial chemoembolization. The recommendations for liver transplantation have not changed. No new data have emerged that can be used to define a new limit for expanding the patient selection criteria. The usefulness of portal pressure measurement to predict the outcome of patients and define optimal candidates for resection has been validated in Japan.12 Thus, resection should remain the first option for patients who have the optimal profile, as defined by the BCLC staging system. Although resection can be performed in some of these patients with advanced liver disease, the mortality is higher and they might be better served by liver transplantation or ablation. A cohort study of radiofrequency ablation demonstrated that complete ablation of lesions smaller than 2 cm is possible in more than 90% of cases, with a local recurrence rate of less than 1%.13 These data should be confirmed by other groups before positioning ablation as the first-line approach for very early HCC. The recommendations regarding patient selection and method of administration of chemoembolization are unchanged. Radioembolization, i.e., the intra-arterial injection of yttrium-90 bound to glass beads or to resin, has been shown to induce tumor necrosis, but there are no data comparing its efficacy to transarterial chemoembolization or to sorafenib treatment for those with portal vein invasion. However, for patients who have either failed transarterial chemoembolization or who present with more advanced HCC, new data indicates the efficacy of sorafenib (a multikinase inhibitor with activity against Raf-1, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, c-Kit receptors, among other kinases) in prolonging life.14, 15 Sorafenib induces a clinically relevant improvement in time to progression and in survival The magnitude of the improvement in survival compares with other established molecular targeted therapies for other advanced cancers, and the associated toxicity is easily managed without treatment-related mortality. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea (sorafenib versus placebo: 11% versus 2%) and hand\u2013foot skin reaction (sorafenib versus placebo: 8% versus <1%), fatigue, and weight loss. Sorafenib is now considered first-line treatment in patients with HCC who can no longer be treated with potentially more effective therapies. In summary, in the past decade HCC has gone from being an almost universal death sentence to a cancer that can be prevented, detected at an early stage, and effectively treated. Physicians caring for patients at risk need to provide high-quality screening, proper management of screen-detected lesions, and provision of therapy that is most appropriate for the stage of disease."

In this paper, we tackle the challenge of automatically inferring boredom from mobile phone usage. In a two-week in-the-wild study, we collected over 40,000,000 usage logs and 4398 boredom self-reports of 54 mobile phone users. We show that a user-independent machine-learning model of boredom --leveraging features related to recency of communication, usage intensity, time of day, and demographics-- can infer boredom with an accuracy (AUCROC) of up to 82.9%. Results from a second field study with 16 participants suggest that people are more likely to engage with recommended content when they are bored, as inferred by our boredom-detection model. These findings enable boredom-triggered proactive recommender systems that attune their users' level of attention and need for stimulation."

    "title": "Contextual Hybrid Session-Based News Recommendation With Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems help users deal with information overload by providing tailored item suggestions to them. The recommendation of news is often considered to be challenging, since the relevance of an article for a user can depend on a variety of factors, including the user's short-term reading interests, the reader's context, or the recency or popularity of an article. Previous work has shown that the use of Recurrent Neural Networks is promising for the next-in-session prediction task, but has certain limitations when only recorded item click sequences are used as input. In this work, we present a contextual hybrid, deep learning based approach for session-based news recommendation that is able to leverage a variety of information types. We evaluated our approach on two public datasets, using a temporal evaluation protocol that simulates the dynamics of a news portal in a realistic way. Our results confirm the benefits of considering additional types of information, including article popularity and recency, in the proposed way, resulting in significantly higher recommendation accuracy and catalog coverage than other session-based algorithms. Additional experiments show that the proposed parameterizable loss function used in our method also allows us to balance two usually conflicting quality factors, accuracy and novelty.

The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being."

    "title": "Bias and Debias in Recommender System: A Survey and Future Directions",
    "abstract": "While recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research papers on recommender system (RS) , most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology \u201cbias\u201d is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic.

    "title": "Model-based collaborative filtering as a defense against profile injection attacks",
    "abstract": "The open nature of collaborative recommender systems allows attackers who inject biased profile data to have a significant impact on the recommendations produced. Standard memory-based collaborative filtering algorithms, such as k- nearest neighbor, have been shown to be quite vulnerable to such attacks. In this paper, we examine the robustness of model-based recommendation algorithms in the face of profile injection attacks. In particular, we consider two recommendation algorithms, one based on k-means clustering and the other based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). These algorithms aggregate similar users into user segments that are compared to the profile of an active user to generate recommendations. Traditionally, model-based algorithms have been used to alleviate the scalability problems associated with memory-based recommender systems. We show, empirically, that these algorithms also offer significant improvements in stability and robustness over the standard k- nearest neighbor approach when attacked. Furthermore, our results show that, particularly, the PLSA-based approach can achieve comparable recommendation accuracy."

    "title": "Analyzing and Predicting Students\u2019 Performance by Means of Machine Learning: A Review",
    "abstract": "Predicting students\u2019 performance is one of the most important topics for learning contexts such as schools and universities, since it helps to design effective mechanisms that improve academic results and avoid dropout, among other things. These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students\u2019 activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students\u2019 knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students\u2019 performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students\u2019 performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others."

    "abstract": "During the 1980s, widespread dissatisfaction with America's schools gave rise to a powerful movement for educational change, and the nation's political institutions responded with aggressive reforms. Chubb and Moe argue that these reforms are destined to fail because they do not get to the root of the problem. The fundamental causes of poor academic performance, they claim, are not to be found in the schools, but rather in the institutions of direct democratic control by which the schools have traditionally been governed. Reformers fail to solve the problem-when the institutions ARE the problem. The authors recommend a new system of public education, built around parent-student choice and school competition, that would promote school autonomy thus providing a firm foundation for genuine school improvement and superior student achievement."

    "title": "Entire Space Multi-Task Model",
    "abstract": "Estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) accurately is crucial for ranking systems in industrial applications such as recommendation and advertising. Conventional CVR modeling applies popular deep learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However it encounters several task-specific problems in practice, making CVR modeling challenging. For example, conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions. This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme data sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this paper, we model CVR in a brand-new perspective by making good use of sequential pattern of user actions, i.e., impression -> click -> conversion. The proposed Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) can eliminate the two problems simultaneously by i) modeling CVR directly over the entire space, ii) employing a feature representation transfer learning strategy. Experiments on dataset gathered from Taobao's recommender system demonstrate that ESMM significantly outperforms competitive methods. We also release a sampling version of this dataset to enable future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset which contains samples with sequential dependence of click and conversion labels for CVR modeling."

    "abstract": "Ontology and knowledge-based systems typically provide e-learning recommender systems. However, ontology use in such systems is not well studied in systematic detail. Therefore, this research examines the development and evaluation of ontology-based recommender systems. The study also discusses technical ontology use and the recommendation process. We identified multidisciplinary ontology-based recommender systems in 28 journal articles. These systems combined ontology with artificial intelligence, computing technology, education, education psychology, and social sciences. Student models and learning objects remain the primary ontology use, followed by feedback, assessments, and context data. Currently, the most popular recommendation item is the learning object, but learning path, feedback, and learning device could be the future considerations. This recommendation process is reciprocal and can be initiated either by the system or students. Standard ontology languages are commonly used, but standards for student profiles and learning object metadata are rarely adopted. Moreover, ontology-based recommender systems seldom use the methodology of building ontologies and hardly use other ontology methodologies. Similarly, none of the primary studies described ontology evaluation methodologies, but the systems are evaluated by nonreal students, algorithmic performance tests, statistics, questionnaires, and qualitative observations. In conclusion, the findings support the implementation of ontology methodologies and the integration of ontology-based recommendations into existing learning technologies. The study also promotes the use of recommender systems in social science and humanities courses, non-higher education, and open learning environments."

    "title": "Exploring social influence for recommendation",
    "abstract": "Social friendship has been shown beneficial for item recommendation for years. However, existing approaches mostly incorporate social friendship into recommender systems by heuristics. In this paper, we argue that social influence between friends can be captured quantitatively and propose a probabilistic generative model, called social influenced selection(SIS), to model the decision making of item selection (e.g., what book to buy or where to dine). Based on SIS, we mine the social influence between linked friends and the personal preferences of users through statistical inference. To address the challenges arising from multiple layers of hidden factors in SIS, we develop a new parameter learning algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). Moreover, we show that the mined social influence and user preferences are valuable for group recommendation and viral marketing. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation using real datasets crawled from last.fm and whrrl.com to validate our proposal. Experimental results show that social influence captured based on our SIS model is effective for enhancing both item recommendation and group recommendation, essential for viral marketing, and useful for various user analysis."

    "abstract": "Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. In this work we design a cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups."

Indeed, the problem of POI recommendation is to provide personalized recommendations of places of interest. Unlike traditional recommendation tasks, POI recommendation is personalized, location-aware, and context depended. In light of this difference, this paper proposes a topic and location aware POI recommender system by exploiting associated textual and context information. Specifically, we first exploit an aggregated latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to learn the interest topics of users and to infer the interest POIs by mining textual information associated with POIs. Then, a Topic and Location-aware probabilistic matrix factorization (TL-PMF) method is proposed for POI recommendation. A unique perspective of TL-PMF is to consider both the extent to which a user interest matches the POI in terms of topic distribution and the word-of-mouth opinions of the POIs. Finally, experiments on real-world LBSNs data show that the proposed recommendation method outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic latent factor models with a significant margin. Also, we have studied the impact of personalized interest topics and word-of-mouth opinions on POI recommendations.

    "title": "Making Decisions about Privacy",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems increasingly use contextual and demographical data as a basis for recommendations. Users, however, often feel uncomfortable providing such information. In a privacy-minded design of recommenders, users are free to decide for themselves what data they want to disclose about themselves. But this decision is often complex and burdensome, because the consequences of disclosing personal information are uncertain or even unknown. Although a number of researchers have tried to analyze and facilitate such information disclosure decisions, their research results are fragmented, and they often do not hold up well across studies. This article describes a unified approach to privacy decision research that describes the cognitive processes involved in users\u2019 \u201cprivacy calculus\u201d in terms of system-related perceptions and experiences that act as mediating factors to information disclosure. The approach is applied in an online experiment with 493 participants using a mock-up of a context-aware recommender system. Analyzing the results with a structural linear model, we demonstrate that personal privacy concerns and disclosure justification messages affect the perception of and experience with a system, which in turn drive information disclosure decisions. Overall, disclosure justification messages do not increase disclosure. Although they are perceived to be valuable, they decrease users\u2019 trust and satisfaction. Another result is that manipulating the order of the requests increases the disclosure of items requested early but decreases the disclosure of items requested later."

    "title": "Multi-Criteria Review-Based Recommender System\u2013The State of the Art",
    "abstract": "In recent times, the recommender systems (RSs) have considerable importance in academia, commercial activities, and industry. They are widely used in various domains such as shopping (Amazon), music (Pandora), movies (Netflix), travel (TripAdvisor), restaurant (Yelp), people (Facebook), and articles (TED). Most of the RSs approaches rely on a single-criterion rating (overall rating) as a primary source for the recommendation process. However, the overall rating is not enough to gain high accuracy of recommendations because the overall rating cannot express fine-grained analysis behind the user's behavior. To solve this problem, multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRSs) have been developed to improve the accuracy of the RS performance. Additionally, a new source of information represented by the user-generated reviews is incorporated in the recommendation process because of the rich and numerous information included (i.e. review elements) related to the whole item or to a certain feature of the item or the user's preferences. The valuable review elements are extracted using either text mining or sentiment analysis. MCRSs benefit from the review elements of the user-generated reviews in building their criteria forming multi-criteria review based recommender systems. The review elements improve the accuracy of the RS performance and mitigate most of the RS's problems such as the cold start and sparsity. In this review, we focused on the multi-criteria review-based recommender system and explained the user reviews elements in detail and how these can be integrated into the RSs to help develop their criteria to enhance the RSs performance. Finally, based on the survey, we presented four future trends based on this type of RSs to support researchers who wish to pursue studies in this area."

In the proposed approach, we first use a hybrid recommendation method to generate a preliminary recommendation list. Then sentiment analysis is employed to optimize the list. Finally, the hybrid recommender system with sentiment analysis is implemented on Spark platform. The hybrid recommendation model with sentiment analysis outperforms the traditional models in terms of various evaluation criteria. Our proposed method makes it convenient and fast for users to obtain useful movie suggestions."

Currently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most popular algorithms for matrix factorization. However, as a sequential approach, SGD is difficult to be parallelized for handling web-scale problems. In this paper, we develop a fast parallel SGD method, FPSGD, for shared memory systems. By dramatically reducing the cache-miss rate and carefully addressing the load balance of threads, FPSGD is more efficient than state-of-the-art parallel algorithms for matrix factorization."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been based on context and content, and now the technological challenge of making personalized recommendations based on the user emotional state arises through physiological signals that are obtained from devices or sensors. This paper applies the deep learning approach using a deep convolutional neural network on a dataset of physiological signals (electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response), in this case, the AMIGOS dataset. The detection of emotions is done by correlating these physiological signals with the data of arousal and valence of this dataset, to classify the affective state of a person. In addition, an application for emotion recognition based on classic machine learning algorithms is proposed to extract the features of physiological signals in the domain of time, frequency, and non-linear. This application uses a convolutional neural network for the automatic feature extraction of the physiological signals, and through fully connected network layers, the emotion prediction is made. The experimental results on the AMIGOS dataset show that the method proposed in this paper achieves a better precision of the classification of the emotional states, in comparison with the originally obtained by the authors of this dataset."

We split each single user prole into several possibly overlapping sub-proles, each representing users in particular contexts. The predictions are done using these micro-proles instead of a single user model. The users\u2019 taste can depend on the exact partition of the contextual variable. The identication of a meaningful partition of the users\u2019 prole and its evaluation is a non-trivial task, especially when using implicit feedback and a continuous contextual domain. We propose an o-line evaluation procedure for CARS in these conditions and evaluate our approach on a time-aware music recommendation sytem."

    "abstract": "With the advent of the Internet of Things, especially the Internet of Vehicles, abundant environmental and mobile data can be generated continuously. A personalized recommender system is one of the important methods for solving the problem of big data overload. However, to make use of these mobile data from vehicles, traditional recommender services are confronted by severe challenges. Therefore, we study the diversified recommendation problem based on a real-world dataset, represented as a tensor with three dimensions of user, location and activity. As the tensor is rather sparse, we employ tensor decomposition to predict missing values. Additionally, we directly regard recommendation precision as an objective. In addition to precision, we also consider the recommendation novelty and coverage, providing a more comprehensive view of the recommender system. Thus, visitors can discover attractive spots that are less visited in a personalized manner, relieving traffic pressure at famous scenic spots and balancing overall transportation. By integrating all these objectives, we construct a many-objective recommendation model. To optimize this model, we propose a distributed parallel evolutionary algorithm employing the nondominated ranking and crowding distance. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm performs well and is very efficient."

However, news recommendation is challenging because the most relevant articles are often new content seen by few users. In addition, they are subject to trends and preference changes over time, and in many cases we do not have sufficient information to profile the reader. In this paper, we introduce a class of news recommendation systems based on context trees. They can provide high-quality news recommendation to anonymous visitors based on present browsing behaviour. We show that context-tree recommender systems provide good prediction accuracy and recommendation novelty, and they are sufficiently flexible to capture the unique properties of news articles."

Such datasets often include sensitive information, yet most recommender systems are focusing on the models' accuracy and ignore issues related to security and the users' privacy. Despite the efforts to overcome these problems using different risk reduction techniques, none of them has been completely successful in ensuring cryptographic security and protection of the users' private information. To bridge this gap, the blockchain technology is presented as a promising strategy to promote security and privacy preservation in recommender systems, not only because of its security and privacy salient features, but also due to its resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance and trust characteristics. This paper presents a holistic review of blockchain-based recommender systems covering challenges, open issues and solutions. Accordingly, a well-designed taxonomy is introduced to describe the security and privacy challenges, overview existing frameworks and discuss their applications and benefits when using blockchain before indicating opportunities for future research."

Today radio shows are often programmed by large corporations that create playlists drawn from a limited pool of tracks. Similarly, record stores have been replaced by big-box retailers that have ever-shrinking music departments. Instead of relying on DJs, record-store clerks or their friends for music recommendations, listeners are turning to machines to guide them to new music. In this book, scar Celma guides us through the world of automatic music recommendation. He describes how music recommenders work, explores some of the limitations seen in current recommenders, offers techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of music recommendations and demonstrates how to build effective recommenders by offering two real-world recommender examples. He emphasizes the user's perceived quality, rather than the system's predictive accuracy when providing recommendations, thus allowing users to discover new music by exploiting the long tail of popularity and promoting novel and relevant material (non-obvious recommendations). In order to reach out into the long tail, he needs to weave techniques from complex network analysis and music information retrieval. Aimed at final-year-undergraduate and graduate students working on recommender systems or music information retrieval, this book presents the state of the art of all the different techniques used to recommend items, focusing on the music domain as the underlying application."

    "title": "Social Recommendation with an Essential Preference Space",
    "abstract": "Social recommendation, which aims to exploit social information to improve the quality of a recommender system, has attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years. A large portion of existing social recommendation models are based on the tractable assumption that users consider the same factors to make decisions in both recommender systems and social networks. However, this assumption is not in concert with real-world situations, since users usually show different preferences in different scenarios. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the differences between user preference in recommender systems and that in social networks, with the aim to further improve the social recommendation. In particular, we assume that the user preferences in different scenarios are results of different linear combinations from a more underlying user preference space. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel social recommendation framework, called social recommendation with an essential preferences space (SREPS), which simultaneously models the structural information in the social network, the rating and the consumption information in the recommender system under the capture of essential preference space. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SREPS model compared with seven state-of-the-art social recommendation methods."

Instead of using the objects directly to represent the user profile, we propose to use the tags associated with the specified objects to build the user profile. We have designed a prototype for the research domain to use such tag-based profiles in finding persons with similar interests. The combination of tag-based profiles with standard recommender system tech- nology has resulted in a new kind of recommender system to recommend related publications, keywords, and persons. Especially the latter is useful to find persons to potentially cooperate with and to monitor the community to be able to enhance a user's current Community of Practice."

In this paper, we investigate the problem of streaming recommendations being subject to higher input rates than they can immediately process with their available system resources (i.e., CPU and memory). In particular, we provide a principled framework called as SPMF (Stream-centered Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model), based on BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking) optimization framework, for performing efficient ranking based recommendations in stream settings. Experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate the superiority of SPMF in online recommendations."

Quite recently, conversational approaches have been introduced in order to support more interactive recommendation sessions. Notwithstanding the increased interactivity offered by these approaches, the system employs an interaction strategy that is specified apriori (at design time) and followed quite rigidly during the interaction. In this paper, we present a new type of recommender system which is capable of learning autonomously an adaptive interaction strategy for assisting the users in acquiring their interaction goals. We view the recommendation process as a sequential decision problem and we model it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We learn a model of the user behavior, and use it to acquire the adaptive strategy using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. In this context, the system learns the optimal strategy by observing the consequences of its actions on the users and also on the final outcome of the recommendation session. We apply our approach within an existing travel recommender system which uses a rigid, non-adaptive support strategy for advising a user in refining a query to a travel product catalogue. The initial results demonstrate the value of our approach and show that our system is able to improve the non-adaptive strategy in order to learn an optimal (adaptive) recommendation strategy."

    "abstract": "Attributes are visual concepts that can be detected by machines, understood by humans, and shared across categories. They are particularly useful for fine-grained domains where categories are closely related to one other (e.g. bird species recognition). In such scenarios, relevant attributes are often local (e.g. \"white belly\"), but the question of how to choose these local attributes remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an interactive approach that discovers local attributes that are both discriminative and semantically meaningful from image datasets annotated only with fine-grained category labels and object bounding boxes. Our approach uses a latent conditional random field model to discover candidate attributes that are detectable and discriminative, and then employs a recommender system that selects attributes likely to be semantically meaningful. Human interaction is used to provide semantic names for the discovered attributes. We demonstrate our method on two challenging datasets, Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 and Leeds Butterflies, and find that our discovered attributes outperform those generated by traditional approaches."

    "title": "An intelligent recommender system using sequential Web access patterns",
    "abstract": "To provide intelligent personalized online services such as Web recommendations, it is usually necessary to model users' Web access behavior. To achieve this, one of the promising approaches is Web usage mining, which mines Web logs for user models and recommendations. Different from most Web recommender systems that are mainly based on clustering and association rule mining, this paper proposes an intelligent Web recommender system known as SWARS (sequential Web access-based recommender system) that uses sequential access pattern mining. In the proposed system, CS-mine, an efficient sequential pattern mining algorithm is used to identify frequent sequential Web access patterns. The access patterns are then stored in a compact tree structure, called Pattern-tree, which is then used for matching and generating Web links for recommendations. In this paper, the proposed SWARS system is described, and its performance is evaluated based on precision, satisfaction and applicability."

    "title": "Latent Factor-Based Recommenders Relying on Extended Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices generated by recommender systems contain rich knowledge regarding various desired patterns like users' potential preferences and community tendency. Latent factor (LF) analysis proves to be highly efficient in extracting such knowledge from an HiDS matrix efficiently. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a highly efficient algorithm for building an LF model. However, current LF models mostly adopt a standard SGD algorithm. Can SGD be extended from various aspects in order to improve the resultant models' convergence rate and prediction accuracy for missing data? Are such SGD extensions compatible with an LF model? To answer them, this paper carefully investigates eight extended SGD algorithms to propose eight novel LF models. Experimental results on two HiDS matrices generated by real recommender systems show that compared with an LF model with a standard SGD algorithm, an LF model with extended ones can achieve: 1) higher prediction accuracy for missing data; 2) faster convergence rate; and 3) model diversity."

Collaborative recommender systems recommend items based on similarities and dissimilarities among users' preferences. This paper presents a collaborative recommender system that recommends university elective courses to students by exploiting courses that other similar students had taken. The proposed system employs an association rules mining algorithm as an underlying technique to discover patterns between courses. Experiments were conducted with real datasets to assess the overall performance of the proposed approach."

    "title": "Challenging the long tail recommendation",
    "abstract": "The success of \"infinite-inventory\" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix has been largely attributed to a \"long tail\" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventory is not in high demand, these niche products, unavailable at limited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition, tail product availability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of \"one-stop shopping\" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems, especially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to recommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail recommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected edge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying Hitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve recommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose efficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail items. Finally, we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two entropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on different user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of long tail recommendation. Empirical experiments on two real life datasets show that our proposed algorithms are effective to recommend long tail items and outperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques."

    "abstract": "Many recommender systems suffer from popularity bias: popular items are recommended frequently while less popular, niche products, are recommended rarely or not at all. However, recommending the ignored products in the \"long tail\" is critical for businesses as they are less likely to be discovered. Popularity bias is also against social justice where the entities need to have a fair chance of being served and represented. In this work, I investigate the problem of popularity bias in recommender systems and develop algorithms to address this problem."

    "title": "To explain or not to explain",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been increasingly used in online services that we consume daily, such as Facebook, Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify. However, these systems are often presented to users as a \"black box\", i.e. the rationale for providing individual recommendations remains unexplained to users. In recent years, various attempts have been made to address this black box issue by providing textual explanations or interactive visualisations that enable users to explore the provenance of recommendations. Among other things, results demonstrated benefits in terms of precision and user satisfaction. Previous research had also indicated that personal characteristics such as domain knowledge, trust propensity and persistence may also play an important role on such perceived benefits. Yet, to date, little is known about the effects of personal characteristics on explaining recommendations. To address this gap, we developed a music recommender system with explanations and conducted an online study using a within-subject design. We captured various personal characteristics of participants and administered both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Results indicate that personal characteristics have significant influence on the interaction and perception of recommender systems, and that this influence changes by adding explanations. For people with a low need for cognition are the explained recommendations the most beneficial. For people with a high need for cognition, we observed that explanations could create a lack of confidence. Based on these results, we present some design implications for explaining recommendations."

    "abstract": "This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency. The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review. This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments. We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 \u03bcg) as the \u201cgold standard\u201d diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15\u201325 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20\u201335 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (\u223c8 mg/m2/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease."

    "title": "Deep Session Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction",
    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in many industrial applications, such as online advertising and recommender systems. How to capture users' dynamic and evolving interests from their behavior sequences remains a continuous research topic in the CTR prediction. However, most existing studies overlook the intrinsic structure of the sequences: the sequences are composed of sessions, where sessions are user behaviors separated by their occurring time. We observe that user behaviors are highly homogeneous in each session, and heterogeneous cross sessions. Based on this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named Deep Session Interest Network (DSIN) that leverages users' multiple historical sessions in their behavior sequences. We first use self-attention mechanism with bias encoding to extract users' interests in each session. Then we apply Bi-LSTM to model how users' interests evolve and interact among sessions. Finally, we employ the local activation unit to adaptively learn the influences of various session interests on the target item. Experiments are conducted on both advertising and production recommender datasets and DSIN outperforms other state-of-the-art models on both datasets."

Recommender systems help where explicit search queries are not available or are difficult to formulate, learning the type of thing users like over a period of time.We explore an ontological approach to user profiling in the context of a recommender system. Building on previous work involving ontological profile inference and the use of external ontologies to overcome the cold-start problem, we explore the idea of profile visualization to capture further knowledge about user interests. Our system, called Foxtrot, examines the problem of recommending on-line research papers to academic researchers. Both our ontological approach to user profiling and our visualization of user profiles are novel ideas to recommender systems. A year long experiment is conducted with over 200 staff and students at the University of Southampton. The effectiveness of visualizing profiles and eliciting profile feedback is measured, as is the overall effectiveness of the recommender system."

Over the last several years, ACM RecSys has become a flagship event in the area of recommender systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world have an opportunity to meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. This year, ACM RecSys had 169 submissions from 42 different countries that were sent out for review. As was the case in the last few years, there were two paper submission categories: long papers (that should report on substantial contributions of lasting value) and short papers (that typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper). Out of 110 long paper submissions, 22 were accepted (20.0%) for oral presentation at the conference. In addition, to accommodate the growing number of quality long paper submissions over the years, 8 additional long papers were accepted for poster presentation (resulting in the final acceptance rate of 27.3% for long paper submissions). Out of 59 short paper submissions, 24 were accepted (40.7%) for poster presentation at the conference. In addition to the paper presentations, the conference program includes a multitude of other interesting events. These events include: two keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Noshir Contractor (Northwestern University) and one from an industrial perspective by Neel Sundaresan (eBay Research Labs); a highly diverse industry track featuring Andrew Tomkins (Google), Rajat Raina (Facebook), Jon Sanders (Netflix), Pankaj Gupta (Twitter) and Eric Bieschke (Pandora); a record number of nine workshops; three invited tutorials; a doctoral symposium; and a panel on the latest emerging issues that are important to the field."

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs have proven to be extremely valuable to recommender systems, as they enable hybrid graph-based recommendation models encompassing both collaborative and content information. Leveraging this wealth of heterogeneous information for top-N item recommendation is a challenging task, as it requires the ability of effectively encoding a diversity of semantic relations and connectivity patterns. In this work, we propose entity2rec, a novel approach to learning user-item relatedness from knowledge graphs for top-N item recommendation. We start from a knowledge graph modeling user-item and item-item relations and we learn property-specific vector representations of users and items applying neural language models on the network. These representations are used to create property-specific user-item relatedness features, which are in turn fed into learning to rank algorithms to learn a global relatedness model that optimizes top-N item recommendations. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of ranking quality on the MovieLens 1M dataset, outperforming a number of state-of-the-art recommender systems, and we assess the importance of property-specific relatedness scores on the overall ranking quality."

We describe an influence-limiting algorithm that can turn existing recommender systems into manipulation-resistant systems. Honest reporting is the optimal strategy for raters who wish to maximize their influence. If an attacker can create only a bounded number of shills, the attacker can mislead only a small amount. However, the system eventually makes full use of information from honest, informative raters. We describe both the influence limits and the information loss incurred due to those limits in terms of information-theoretic concepts of loss functions and entropies."

    "title": "Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Preparing recommendations for unknown users or such that correctly respond to the short-term needs of a particular user is one of the fundamental problems for e-commerce. Most of the common Recommender Systems assume that user identification must be explicit. In this paper a Session-Aware Recommender System approach is presented where no straightforward user information is required. The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations."

    "title": "Towards Cognitive Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Intelligence is the ability to learn from experience and use domain experts\u2019 knowledge to adapt to new situations. In this context, an intelligent Recommender System should be able to learn from domain experts\u2019 knowledge and experience, as it is vital to know the domain that the items will be recommended. Traditionally, Recommender Systems have been recognized as playlist generators for video/music services (e.g., Netflix and Spotify), e-commerce product recommenders (e.g., Amazon and eBay), or social content recommenders (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). However, Recommender Systems in modern enterprises are highly data-/knowledge-driven and may rely on users\u2019 cognitive aspects such as personality, behavior, and attitude. In this paper, we survey and summarize previously published studies on Recommender Systems to help readers understand our method\u2019s contributions to the field in this context. We discuss the current limitations of the state of the art approaches in Recommender Systems and the need for our new approach: A vision and a general framework for a new type of data-driven, knowledge-driven, and cognition-driven Recommender Systems, namely, Cognitive Recommender Systems. Cognitive Recommender Systems will be the new type of intelligent Recommender Systems that understand the user\u2019s preferences, detect changes in user preferences over time, predict user\u2019s unknown favorites, and explore adaptive mechanisms to enable intelligent actions within the compound and changing environments. We present a motivating scenario in banking and argue that existing Recommender Systems: (i) do not use domain experts\u2019 knowledge to adapt to new situations; (ii) may not be able to predict the ratings or preferences a customer would give to a product (e.g., loan, deposit, or trust service); and (iii) do not support data capture and analytics around customers\u2019 cognitive activities and use it to provide intelligent and time-aware recommendations."

However, the utilization of recommender system in academic research itself has not received enough attention. A research paper recommender system would greatly help researchers to find the most desirable papers in their fields of endeavor. Due to the textual nature of papers, content information could be integrated into existed recommendation methods. In this paper, we proposed that by using topic model techniques to make topic analysis on research papers, we could introduce a thematic similarity measurement into a modified version of item-based recommendation approach. This novel recommendation method could considerable alleviate the cold start problem in research paper recommendation. Our experiment result shows that our approach could recommend highly relevant research papers."

Since there are no clear winners in this comparison, we propose an alternative more effective method of selecting the winners in the pre- vs. the post-filtering comparison. This strategy provides analysts and companies with a practical suggestion on how to pick a good pre- or post-filtering approach in an effective manner to improve performance of a context-aware recommender system."

It is personalised and dynamic, and allows to compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based on the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some personalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics. In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations that the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical validation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the performance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative filtering."

Following this new research this paper presents SetFusion, a visual user-controllable interface for hybrid recommender system. Our approach enables users to manually fuse and control the importance of recommender strategies and to inspect the fusion results using an interactive Venn diagram visualization.

Methods ASCO/CAP convened an Update Committee that included coauthors of the 2007 guideline to conduct a systematic literature review and update recommendations for optimal HER2 testing. Results The Update Committee identified criteria and areas requiring clarification to improve the accuracy of HER2 testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH). The guideline was reviewed and approved by both organizations. Recommendations The Update Committee recommends that HER2 status (HER2 negative or positive) be determined in all patients with invasive (early stage or recurrence) breast cancer on the basis of one or more HER2 test results (negative, equivocal, or positive). Testing criteria define HER2-positive status when (on observing within an area of tumor that amounts to &gt; 10% of contiguous and homogeneous tumor cells) there is evidence of protein overexpression (IHC) or gene amplification (HER2 copy number or HER2/CEP17 ratio by ISH based on counting at least 20 cells within the area). If results are equivocal (revised criteria), reflex testing should be performed using an alternative assay (IHC or ISH). Repeat testing should be considered if results seem discordant with other histopathologic findings. Laboratories should demonstrate high concordance with a validated HER2 test on a sufficiently large and representative set of specimens. Testing must be performed in a laboratory accredited by CAP or another accrediting entity. The Update Committee urges providers and health systems to cooperate to ensure the highest quality testing. This guideline was developed through a collaboration between the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both Journal of Clinical Oncology and the Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine.

However, the list of possibilities offered to tourists by these Web search engines (or even specialized tourist sites) can be overwhelming and relevant results are usually drowned in informational \"noise\", which prevents, or at least slows down the selection process. To assist tourists in trip planning and help them to find the information they are looking for, many recommender systems have been developed. In this article, we present an overview of the various recommendation approaches used in the field of tourism. From this study, an architecture and a conceptual framework for tourism recommender system are proposed, based on a hybrid recommendation approach. The proposed system goes beyond the recommendation of a list of tourist attractions, tailored to tourist preferences. It can be seen as a trip planner that designs a detailed program, including heterogeneous tourism resources, for a specific visit duration. The ultimate goal is to develop a recommender system based on big data technologies, artificial intelligence, and operational research to promote tourism in Morocco, specifically in the Daraa-Tafilalet region."

Our explorations show that, over time, user\u2013recommender interactions consistently lead to the longitudinal performance paradox of recommender systems. In particular, users\u2019 reliance on recommendations, while helping users discover relevant items, actually hurts the future diversity of items that are recommended and consumed as well as slows down the system\u2019s learning pace (i.e., the rate of predictive accuracy improvement). We also demonstrate unique benefits of certain hybrid consumption strategies\u2014that is, that take advantage of both popularity- and personalization-based recommendations\u2014in facilitating improvements in consumption relevance over time. Because users\u2019 consumption strategies can significantly influence the longitudinal performance of recommender systems, it is important for designers to analyze the histories of a system\u2019s recommendations and users\u2019 choices to infer and understand users\u2019 consumption strategies. This would enable the system to anticipate users\u2019 consumption behavior and strategically adjust the system\u2019s parameters according to its long-term performance objectives."

In this short commentary, I contextualize this claim about context. The idea that context is crucial to meaning is shared across a wide range of disciplines, including the field of \u2018context-aware\u2019 recommender systems. These personalization systems attempt to take a user\u2019s context into account in order to make better, more useful, more meaningful recommendations. How are we to square boyd and Crawford\u2019s warning with the growth of big data applications that are centrally concerned with something they call \u2018context\u2019? I suggest that the importance of context is uncontroversial; the controversy lies in determining what context is. Drawing on the work of cultural and linguistic anthropologists, I argue that context is constructed by the methods used to apprehend it. For the developers of \u2018context-aware\u2019 recommender systems, context is typically operationalized as a set of sensor readings associated with a user\u2019s activity. For critics like boyd and Crawford, context is that unquantified remainder that haunts mathematical models, making numbers that appear to be identical actually different from each other. These understandings of context seem to be incompatible, and their variability points to the importance of identifying and studying \u2018context cultures\u2019\u2013ways of producing context that vary in goals and techniques, but which agree that context is key to data\u2019s significance. To do otherwise would be to take these contextualizations out of context."

    "title": "On Unexpectedness in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Although the broad social and business success of recommender systems has been achieved across several domains, there is still a long way to go in terms of user satisfaction. One of the key dimensions for significant improvement is the concept of unexpectedness . In this article, we propose a method to improve user satisfaction by generating unexpected recommendations based on the utility theory of economics. In particular, we propose a new concept of unexpectedness as recommending to users those items that depart from what they would expect from the system - the consideration set of each user. We define and formalize the concept of unexpectedness and discuss how it differs from the related notions of novelty, serendipity, and diversity. In addition, we suggest several mechanisms for specifying the users\u2019 expectations and propose specific performance metrics to measure the unexpectedness of recommendation lists. We also take into consideration the quality of recommendations using certain utility functions and present an algorithm for providing users with unexpected recommendations of high quality that are hard to discover but fairly match their interests. Finally, we conduct several experiments on \u201creal-world\u201d datasets and compare our recommendation results with other methods. The proposed approach outperforms these baseline methods in terms of unexpectedness and other important metrics, such as coverage, aggregate diversity and dispersion, while avoiding any accuracy loss."

It is recommended that only that part of Part I up to formula (33) and the portion dealing with star-delta transformations be read before proceeding with Part II. Part I deals with the resolution of unsymmetrical groups of numbers into symmetrical groups. These numbers may represent rotating vectors of systems of operators. A new operator termed the sequence operator is introduced which simplifies the manipulation. Formulas are derived for three-phase circuits. Star-delta transformations for symmetrical co-ordinates are given and expressions for power deduced. A short discussion of harmonics in three-phase systems is given. Part II deals with the practical application of this method to symmetrical rotating machines operating on unsymmetrical circuits. General formulas are derived and such special cases, as the single-phase induction motor, synchronous motor-generator, phase converters of various types, are discussed."

    "abstract": "Due to the widespread availability of implicit feedback (e.g., clicks and purchases), some researchers have endeavored to design recommender systems based on implicit feedback. However, unlike explicit feedback, implicit feedback cannot directly reflect user preferences. Therefore, although more challenging, it is also more practical to use implicit feedback for recommender systems. Traditional collaborative filtering methods such as matrix factorization, which regards user preferences as a linear combination of user and item latent vectors, have limited learning capacities and suffer from data sparsity and the cold-start problem. To tackle these problems, some authors have considered the integration of a deep neural network to learn user and item features with traditional collaborative filtering. However, there is as yet no research combining collaborative filtering and contentbased recommendation with deep learning. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hybrid recommender system framework based on auto-encoders (DHA-RS) by integrating user and item side information to construct a hybrid recommender system and enhance performance. DHA-RS combines stacked denoising auto-encoders with neural collaborative filtering, which corresponds to the process of learning user and item features from auxiliary information to predict user preferences. Experiments performed on the real-world dataset reveal that DHA-RS performs better than state-of-the-art methods."

    "title": "Political communication on social media: A tale of hyperactive users and bias in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "A segment of the political discussions on Online Social Networks (OSNs) is shaped by hyperactive users. These are users that are over-proportionally active in relation to the mean. By applying a geometric topic modeling algorithm (GTM) on German users' political comments and parties' posts and by analyzing commenting and liking activities, we quantitatively demonstrate that hyperactive users have a significant role in the political discourse: They become opinion leaders, as well as having an agenda-setting effect, thus creating an alternate picture of public opinion. We also show that hyperactive users strongly influence specific types of recommender systems. By training collaborative filtering and deep learning recommendation algorithms on simulated political networks, we illustrate that models provide different suggestions to users, when accounting for or ignoring hyperactive behavior both in the input dataset and in the methodology applied. We attack the trained models with adversarial examples by strategically placing hyperactive users in the network and manipulating the recommender systems' results. Given that recommender systems are used by all major social networks, that they come with a social influence bias, and given that OSNs are not per se designed to foster political discussions, we discuss the implications for the political discourse and the danger of algorithmic manipulation of political communication."

    "abstract": "In the world of recommender systems, it is a common practice to use public available datasets from different application environments (e.g. MovieLens, Book-Crossing, or Each-Movie) in order to evaluate recommendation algorithms. These datasets are used as benchmarks to develop new recommendation algorithms and to compare them to other algorithms in given settings. In this paper, we explore datasets that capture learner interactions with tools and resources. We use the datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms for learning. We present an experimental comparison of the accuracy of several collaborative filtering algorithms applied to these TEL datasets and elaborate on implicit relevance data, such as downloads and tags, that can be used to improve the performance of recommendation algorithms."

    "title": "Application Domain and Functional Classification of Recommender Systems\u2014A Survey",
    "abstract": "The amount of scientific and technical information is growing exponentially. As a result, the scientific community has been overwhelmed by the information published in number of new books, journal articles, and conference proceedings. In addition to increasing number of publications, advances in information technology have dramatically reduced the barriers in electronic publishing and distribution of information over networks virtually anywhere in the world. As a result, the scientific community is facing the problem of locating relevant or interesting information. To address the problem of information overload and to sift all available information sources for useful information, recommender systems or filtering systems have emerged. Generally, recommender systems are used online to suggest items that users find interesting, thereby, benefiting both the user and merchant. Recommender systems benefit the user by making him suggestions on items that he is likely to purchase and the business by increase of sales. Filtering information or generation of recommendatio ns by the recommender systems mimic the process of information retrieval systems by incorporating advanced profile building techniques, item/user representation techniques, filtering and recommendation techniques, and profile adaptation techniques. This paper addresses the application domain analysis, functional classification, advantages and disadvantages of various filtering and recommender systems."

    "title": "Beyond clicks",
    "abstract": "Many internet companies, such as Yahoo, Facebook, Google and Twitter, rely on content recommendation systems to deliver the most relevant content items to individual users through personalization. Delivering such personalized user experiences is believed to increase the long term engagement of users. While there has been a lot of progress in designing effective personalized recommender systems, by exploiting user interests and historical interaction data through implicit (item click) or explicit (item rating) feedback, directly optimizing for users' satisfaction with the system remains challenging. In this paper, we explore the idea of using item-level dwell time as a proxy to quantify how likely a content item is relevant to a particular user. We describe a novel method to compute accurate dwell time based on client-side and server-side logging and demonstrate how to normalize dwell time across different devices and contexts. In addition, we describe our experiments in incorporating dwell time into state-of-the-art learning to rank techniques and collaborative filtering models that obtain competitive performances in both offline and online settings."

    "title": "Yahoo! music recommendations",
    "abstract": "In the past decade large scale recommendation datasets were published and extensively studied. In this work we describe a detailed analysis of a sparse, large scale dataset, specifically designed to push the envelope of recommender system models. The Yahoo! Music dataset consists of more than a million users, 600 thousand musical items and more than 250 million ratings, collected over a decade. It is characterized by three unique features: First, rated items are multi-typed, including tracks, albums, artists and genres; Second, items are arranged within a four level taxonomy, proving itself effective in coping with a severe sparsity problem that originates from the unusually large number of items (compared to, e.g., movie ratings datasets). Finally, fine resolution timestamps associated with the ratings enable a comprehensive temporal and session analysis. We further present a matrix factorization model exploiting the special characteristics of this dataset. In particular, the model incorporates a rich bias model with terms that capture information from the taxonomy of items and different temporal dynamics of music ratings. To gain additional insights of its properties, we organized the KddCup-2011 competition about this dataset. As the competition drew thousands of participants, we expect the dataset to attract considerable research activity in the future."

    "title": "Robust collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit.Robust statistics is an area within statistics where estimation methods have been developed that deteriorate more gracefully in the presence of unmodeled noise and slight departures from modeling assumptions. In this work, we study how such robust statistical methods, in particular M-estimators, can be used to generate stable recommendation even in the presence of noise and spam. To that extent, we present a Robust Matrix Factorization algorithm and study its stability. We conclude that M-estimators do not add significant stability to recommendation; however the presented algorithm can outperform existing recommendation algorithms in its recommendation quality."

    "title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition)",
    "abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes.\r\n\r\nFor example, a key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process including the amount and rate of cargo sequestered and degraded). In particular, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation must be differentiated from stimuli that increase autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. It is worth emphasizing here that lysosomal digestion is a stage of autophagy and evaluating its competence is a crucial part of the evaluation of autophagic flux, or complete autophagy.\r\n\r\nHere, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. Along these lines, because of the potential for pleiotropic effects due to blocking autophagy through genetic manipulation, it is imperative to target by gene knockout or RNA interference more than one autophagy-related protein. In addition, some individual Atg proteins, or groups of proteins, are involved in other cellular pathways implying that not all Atg proteins can be used as a specific marker for an autophagic process. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field."

To improve recommendation performance, usage, and scalability, the research has evolved by producing several generations of recommender systems. There is much literature about it, although most proposals focus on traditional methods\u2019 theories and applications. Recently, knowledge graph-based recommendations have attracted attention in academia and the industry because they can alleviate information sparsity and performance problems. We found only two studies that analyze the recommendation system\u2019s role over graphs, but they focus on specific recommendation methods. This survey attempts to cover a broader analysis from a set of selected papers. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we explore traditional and more recent developments of filtering methods for a recommender system, (2) we identify and analyze proposals related to knowledge graph-based recommender systems, (3) we present the most relevant contributions using an application domain, and (4) we outline future directions of research in the domain of recommender systems. As the main survey result, we found that the use of knowledge graphs for recommendations is an efficient way to leverage and connect a user\u2019s and an item\u2019s knowledge, thus providing more precise results for users."

    "title": "Multirelational Social Recommendations via Multigraph Ranking",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to identify relevant items for particular users in large-scale online applications. The historical rating data of users is a valuable input resource for many recommendation models such as collaborative filtering (CF), but these models are known to suffer from the rating sparsity problem when the users or items under consideration have insufficient rating records. With the continued growth of online social networks, the increased user-to-user relationships are reported to be helpful and can alleviate the CF rating sparsity problem. Although researchers have developed a range of social network-based recommender systems, there is no unified model to handle multirelational social networks. To address this challenge, this paper represents different user relationships in a multigraph and develops a multigraph ranking model to identify and recommend the nearest neighbors of particular users in high-order environments. We conduct empirical experiments on two real-world datasets: 1) Epinions and 2) Last.fm, and the comprehensive comparison with other approaches demonstrates that our model improves recommendation performance in terms of both recommendation coverage and accuracy, especially when the rating data are sparse."

    "title": "Algorithms of Unconstrained Non-Negative Latent Factor Analysis for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Non-negativity is vital for a latent factor (LF)-based model to preserve the important feature of a high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrix in recommender systems, i.e., none of its entries is negative. Current non-negative models rely on constraints-combined training schemes. However, they lack flexibility, scalability, or compatibility with general training schemes. This work aims to perform unconstrained non-negative latent factor analysis (UNLFA) on HiDS matrices. To do so, we innovatively transfer the non-negativity constraints from the decision parameters to the output LFs, and connect them through a single-element-dependent mapping function. Then we theoretically prove that by making a mapping function fulfill specific conditions, the resultant model is able to represent the original one precisely. We subsequently design highly efficient UNLFA algorithms for recommender systems. Experimental results on four industrial-size HiDS matrices demonstrate that compared with four state-of-the-art non-negative models, a UNLFA-based model obtains advantage in prediction accuracy for missing data and computational efficiency. Moreover, such high performance is achieved through its unconstrained training process which is compatible with various general training schemes, on the premise of fulfilling non-negativity constraints. Hence, UNLFA algorithms are highly valuable for industrial applications with the need of performing non-negative latent factor analysis on HiDS matrices."

    "abstract": "Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful.

    "abstract": "To recommend the next item to a user in a transactional context is practical yet challenging in applications such as marketing campaigns. Transactional context refers to the items that are observable in a transaction. Most existing transaction based recommender systems (TBRSs) make recommendations by mainly considering recently occurring items instead of all the ones observed in the current context. Moreover, they often assume a rigid order between items within a transaction, which is not always practical. More importantly, a long transaction often contains many items irreverent to the next choice, which tends to overwhelm the influence of a few truly relevant ones. Therefore, we posit that a good TBRS should not only consider all the observed items in the current transaction but also weight them with different relevance to build an attentive context that outputs the proper next item with a high probability. To this end, we design an effective attention based transaction embedding model (ATEM) for context embedding to weight each observed item in a transaction without assuming order. The empirical study on real-world transaction datasets proves that ATEM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and novelty."

    "title": "Improving the Effectiveness of Collaborative Filtering on Anonymous Web Usage Data",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems based on collaborative filtering usually require real-time comparison of users\u2019 ratings on objects. In the context of Web personalization, particularly at the early stages of a visitor\u2019s interaction with the site (i.e., before registration or authentication), recommender systems must rely on anonymous clickstream data. The lack of explicit user ratings and the shear amount of data in such a setting poses serious challenges to standard collaborative filtering techniques in terms of scalability and performance. Offline clustering of users transactions can be used to improve the scalability of collaborative filtering, however, this is often at the cost of reduced recommendation accuracy. In this paper we study the impact of various preprocessing techniques applied to clickstream data, such as clustering, normalization, and significance filtering, on collaborative filtering. Our experimental results, performed on real usage data, indicate that with proper data preparation, the clustering-based approach to collaborative filtering can achieve dramatic improvements in terms of recommendation effectiveness, while maintaining the computational advantage over the direct approaches such as the k-NearestNeighbor technique."

It implements the state-of-the-art context-aware recommendation algorithms, and we will showcase the ease with which CARSKit allows recommenders to be configured and evaluated in this demo."

    "title": "Serendipitous Recommendation in E-Commerce Using Innovator-Based Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have been widely used to build recommender systems since they have distinguishing capability of sharing collective wisdoms and experiences. However, they may easily fall into the trap of the Matthew effect, which tends to recommend popular items and hence less popular items become increasingly less popular. Under this circumstance, most of the items in the recommendation list are already familiar to users and therefore the performance would seriously degenerate in finding cold items, i.e., new items and niche items. To address this issue, in this paper, a user survey is first conducted on the online shopping habits in China, based on which a novel recommendation algorithm termed innovator-based CF is proposed that can recommend cold items to users by introducing the concept of innovators. Specifically, innovators are a special subset of users who can discover cold items without the help of recommender system. Therefore, cold items can be captured in the recommendation list via innovators, achieving the balance between serendipity and accuracy. To confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the dataset provided by Alibaba Group in Ali Mobile Recommendation Algorithm Competition, which is collected from the real e-commerce environment and covers massive user behavior log data."

    "abstract": "Abstract Social tags are user-generated keywords associated with some resource on the Web. In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of \"Web 2.0\" recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these social tags directly from MP3 files. Using a set of 360 classifiers trained using the online ensemble learning algorithm FilterBoost, we map audio features onto social tags collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the \"cold-start problem\" common in such systems. Autotags can also be used to smooth the tag space from which similarities and recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system. Because the words we learn are the same as those used by people who label their music collections, it is easy to integrate our predictions into existing similarity and prediction methods based on web data."

    "title": "Privacy-Aware Cross-Platform Service Recommendation Based on Enhanced Locality-Sensitive Hashing",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are a promising way for users to quickly find the valuable information that they are interested in from massive data. Concretely, by capturing the user's personalized preferences, a recommender system can return a list of recommended items that best match the user preferences by using collaborative filtering. However, in the big data environment, the heavily fragmented distribution of the QoS (Quality of Services) data for recommendation decision- making presents a large challenge when integrating the QoS data from different platforms while ensuring that the sensitive user information contained in the QoS data is secure. Furthermore, due to the common tradeoff between data availability and privacy in data-driven applications, protecting the sensitive user information contained in the QoS data will probably decrease the availability of QoS data and finally produce inaccurate recommendation results. Considering these challenges, we enhance the classic Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique, after which we propose an approach based on enhanced LSH for accurate and less-sensitive cross-platform recommendation decision-makings. Finally, extensive experiments are designed and tested on the reputable WS-DREAM dataset. The test reports prove the benefits of our work compared to other competitive approaches in the aspects of recommendation accuracy, efficiency and privacy protection performances."

    "title": "A Fuzzy Tree Matching-Based Personalized E-Learning Recommender System",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of e-learning systems provides learners with great opportunities to access learning activities online, and this greatly supports and enhances the learning practices. However, an issue reduces the success of application of e-learning systems; too many learning activities (such as various leaning materials, subjects, and learning resources) are emerging in an e-learning system, making it difficult for individual learners to select proper activities for their particular situations/requirements because there is no personalized service function. Recommender systems, which aim to provide personalized recommendations for products or services, can be used to solve this issue. However, e-learning systems need to be able to handle certain special requirements: 1) leaning activities and learners' profiles often present tree structures; 2) learning activities contain vague and uncertain data, such as the uncertain categories that the learning activities belong to; 3) there are pedagogical issues, such as the precedence relations between learning activities. To deal with the three requirements, this study first proposes a fuzzy tree-structured learning activity model, and a learner profile model to comprehensively describe the complex learning activities and learner profiles. In the two models, fuzzy category trees and related similarity measures are presented to infer the semantic relations between learning activities or learner requirements. Since it is impossible to have two completely same trees, in practice, a fuzzy tree matching method is carefully discussed. A fuzzy tree matching-based hybrid learning activity recommendation approach is then developed. This approach takes advantage of both the knowledge-based and collaborative filtering-based recommendation approaches, and considers both the semantic and collaborative filtering similarities between learners. Finally, an e-learning recommender system prototype is well designed and developed based on the proposed models and recommendation approach. Experiments are done to evaluate the proposed recommendation approach, and the experimental results demonstrate the good accuracy performance of the proposed approach. A comprehensive case study about learning activity recommendation further demonstrates the effectiveness of the fuzzy tree matching-based personalized e-learning recommender system in practice."

    "abstract": "We consider sequential decision problems under uncertainty, where we seek to optimize an unknown function from noisy samples. This requires balancing exploration (learning about the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a problem well-studied in the multiarmed bandit literature. In many applications, however, we require that the sampled function values exceed some prespecified threshold, a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples include medical applications where patient comfort must be guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to avoid controls causing physical harm to the platform. We tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under the assumption that the unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop an efficient algorithm called SAFEOPT, and theoretically guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum reachable under safety constraints. We evaluate SAFEOPT on synthetic data, as well as two real applications: movie recommendation, and therapeutic spinal cord stimulation."

One crucial unsolved problem for recommender systems is how best to learn about a new user. In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre-existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions."

However, not much research has been done to measure the learning outcomes of the learners when they use e-learning with a recommender system. Instead, most of the researchers were focusing on the accuracy of the recommender system in predicting the recommendation rather than the knowledge gain by the learners. This research aims to compare the learning outcomes of the learners when they use several types of e-learning recommender systems. Based on the comparison made, we propose a new e-learning recommender system framework that uses content-based filtering and good learners' ratings to recommend learning materials, and in turn is able to increase the student's performance. The results show that students who used the proposed e-learning recommender system produced a significantly better result in the post-test. The results also show that the proposed e-learning recommender system has the highest percentage of score gain from pre-test to post-test.&lt;/span&gt;"

    "title": "Deep Item-based Collaborative Filtering for Top-N Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Item-based Collaborative Filtering (ICF) has been widely adopted in recommender systems in industry, owing to its strength in user interest modeling and ease in online personalization. By constructing a user\u2019s profile with the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items that are similar to the user\u2019s profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in recent years, significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item similarity (or representation) from data. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing works have only considered linear and shallow relationships between items, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making process of users. In this article, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the nonlinear and higher-order relationships among items. Going beyond modeling only the second-order interaction (e.g., similarity) between two items, we additionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by using nonlinear neural networks. By doing this, we can effectively model the higher-order relationship among items, capturing more complicated effects in user decision-making. For example, it can differentiate which historical itemsets in a user\u2019s profile are more important in affecting the user to make a purchase decision on an item. We treat this solution as a deep variant of ICF, thus term it as DeepICF. To justify our proposal, we perform empirical studies on two public datasets from MovieLens and Pinterest. Extensive experiments verify the highly positive effect of higher-order item interaction modeling with nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that by more fine-grained second-order interaction modeling with attention network, the performance of our DeepICF method can be further improved."

    "abstract": "When building a recommender system, how can we ensure that all items are modeled well? Classically, recommender systems are built, optimized, and tuned to improve a global prediction objective, such as root mean squared error. However, as we demonstrate, these recommender systems often leave many items badly-modeled and thus under-served. Further, we give both empirical and theoretical evidence that no single matrix factorization, under current state-of-the-art methods, gives optimal results for each item."

    "title": "Towards Bayesian Deep Learning: A Framework and Some Existing Methods",
    "abstract": "While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text understanding play an important role in human intelligence, subsequent tasks that involve inference, reasoning, and planning require an even higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This paper proposes a general framework for Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this paper, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics such as the Bayesian treatment of neural networks."

Biased data can lead collaborative-filtering methods to make unfair predictions for users from minority groups. We identify the insufficiency of existing fairness metrics and propose four new metrics that address different forms of unfairness. These fairness metrics can be optimized by adding fairness terms to the learning objective. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our new metrics can better measure fairness than the baseline, and that the fairness objectives effectively help reduce unfairness."

    "title": "Self-Supervised Multi-Channel Hypergraph Convolutional Network for Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Social relations are often used to improve recommendation quality when user-item interaction data is sparse in recommender systems. Most existing social recommendation models exploit pairwise relations to mine potential user preferences. However, real-life interactions among users are very complex and user relations can be high-order. Hypergraph provides a natural way to model high-order relations, while its potentials for improving social recommendation are under-explored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a multi-channel hypergraph convolutional network to enhance social recommendation by leveraging high-order user relations. Technically, each channel in the network encodes a hypergraph that depicts a common high-order user relation pattern via hypergraph convolution. By aggregating the embeddings learned through multiple channels, we obtain comprehensive user representations to generate recommendation results. However, the aggregation operation might also obscure the inherent characteristics of different types of high-order connectivity information. To compensate for the aggregating loss, we innovatively integrate self-supervised learning into the training of the hypergraph convolutional network to regain the connectivity information with hierarchical mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the current SOTA methods, and the ablation study verifies the effectiveness and rationale of the multi-channel setting and the self-supervised task. The implementation of our model is available via https://github.com/Coder-Yu/RecQ."

    "title": "Bundle recommendation in ecommerce",
    "abstract": "Recommender system has become an important component in modern eCommerce. Recent research on recommender systems has been mainly concentrating on improving the relevance or profitability of individual recommended items. But in reality, users are usually exposed to a set of items and they may buy multiple items in one single order. Thus, the relevance or profitability of one item may actually depend on the other items in the set. In other words, the set of recommendations is a bundle with items interacting with each other. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem called the Bundle Recommendation Problem (BRP). By solving the BRP, we are able to find the optimal bundle of items to recommend with respect to preferred business objective. However, BRP is a large-scale NP-hard problem. We then show that it may be sufficient to solve a significantly smaller version of BRP depending on properties of input data. This allows us to solve BRP in real-world applications with millions of users and items. Both offline and online experimental results on a Walmart.com demonstrate the incremental value of solving BRP across multiple baseline models."

    "title": "Active Transfer Learning for Cross-System Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems, especially the newly launched ones, have to deal with the data-sparsity issue, where little existing rating information is available. Recently, transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging the knowledge from related recommender systems where rich collaborative data are available. However, most previous transfer learning models assume that entity-correspondences across different systems are given as input, which means that for any entity (e.g., a user or an item) in a target system, its corresponding entity in a source system is known. This assumption can hardly be satisfied in real-world scenarios where entity-correspondences across systems are usually unknown, and the cost of identifying them can be expensive. For example, it is extremely difficult to identify whether a user A from Facebook and a user B from Twitter are the same person. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct entity correspondence with limited budget by using active learning to facilitate knowledge transfer across recommender systems. Specifically, for the purpose of maximizing knowledge transfer, we first iteratively select entities in the target system based on our proposed criterion to query their correspondences in the source system. We then plug the actively constructed entity-correspondence mapping into a general transferred collaborative-filtering model to improve recommendation quality. We perform extensive experiments on real world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework for this cross-system recommendation problem."

Various recommender systems employing different data representations and recommendation methods are currently used to address these challenges. In this research, we developed a graph model that provides a generic data representation and can support different recommendation methods. To demonstrate its usefulness and flexibility, we developed three recommendation methods: direct retrieval, association mining, and high\u2010degree association retrieval. We used a data set from an online bookstore as our research test\u2010bed. Evaluation results showed that combining product content information and historical customer transaction information achieved more accurate predictions and relevant recommendations than using only collaborative information. However, comparisons among different methods showed that high\u2010degree association retrieval did not perform significantly better than the association mining method or the direct retrieval method in our test\u2010bed."

    "title": "Novel Recommendation Based on Personal Popularity Tendency",
    "abstract": "Recently, novel recommender systems have attracted considerable attention in the research community. Recommending popular items may not always satisfy users. For example, although most users likely prefer popular items, such items are often not very surprising or novel because users may already know about the items. Also, such recommender systems hardly satisfy a group of users who prefer relatively obscure items. Existing novel recommender systems, however, still recommend mainly popular items or degrade the quality of recommendation. They do so because they do not consider the balance between novelty and preference-based recommendation. This paper proposes an efficient novel-recommendation method called Personal Popularity Tendency Matching (PPTM) which recommends novel items by considering an individual's Personal Popularity Tendency (or PPT). Considering PPT helps to diversify recommendations by reasonably penalizing popular items while improving the recommendation accuracy. We experimentally show that the proposed method, PPTM, is better than other methods in terms of both novelty and accuracy."

    "abstract": "Behaviorism is the currently-dominant paradigm for building and evaluating recommender systems. Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users."

    "title": "Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks",
    "abstract": "The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users' ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events' description and collaborative signals derived from users' RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users' geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users' time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature."

Differently from other approaches, including content based filtering and collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on graphs where the important objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are either explicitly or implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning techniques, exploring and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs is a promising direction for building more effective RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of GLRS, by discussing how they extract knowledge from graphs to improve the accuracy, reliability and explainability of the recommendations. First, we characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key challenges and main progress in this novel research area."

Since the data sparsity problem is quite commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) hence is becoming an emerging research topic in recent years. However, due to the lack of sufficient dense explicit feedbacks and even no feedback available in users' uninvolved domains, current CDCF approaches may not perform satisfactorily in user preference prediction. In this paper, we propose a generalized Cross Domain Triadic Factorization (CDTF) model over the triadic relation user-item-domain, which can better capture the interactions between domain-specific user factors and item factors. In particular, we devise two CDTF algorithms to leverage user explicit and implicit feedbacks respectively, along with a genetic algorithm based weight parameters tuning algorithm to trade off influence among domains optimally. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate our models and compare with other state-of-the-art models by using two real world datasets. The results show the superiority of our models against other comparative models."

This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications."

We find that satisfaction is negatively dependent on novelty and positively dependent on diversity in this setting, and that satisfaction predicts the user's final selection. We also compare users' subjective perceptions of recommendation properties with objective measures of those same characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies modern survey design and analysis techniques to a within-subjects, direct comparison study of recommender algorithms."

The guideline is based on a systematic review of relevant meta\u2010analyses published till June 2016. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co\u2010morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate\u2010 to high\u2010quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep\u2010related breathing disorders), in treatment\u2010resistant insomnia, for professional at\u2010risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high\u2010quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first\u2010line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high\u2010quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and some antidepressants are effective in the short\u2010term treatment of insomnia (\u22644 weeks; weak recommendation, moderate\u2010quality evidence). Antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin and phytotherapeutics are not recommended for insomnia treatment (strong to weak recommendations, low\u2010 to very\u2010low\u2010quality evidence). Light therapy and exercise need to be further evaluated to judge their usefulness in the treatment of insomnia (weak recommendation, low\u2010quality evidence). Complementary and alternative treatments (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not recommended for insomnia treatment (weak recommendation, very\u2010low\u2010quality evidence)."

This altered gut-brain relationship has been treated using gut-selective antibiotics such as rifaximin, that improve cognitive function in HE, especially its subclinical form, minimal HE (MHE). However, the precise mechanism of the action of rifaximin in MHE is unclear. We hypothesized that modulation of gut microbiota and their end-products by rifaximin would affect the gut-brain axis and improve cognitive performance in cirrhosis. Aim To perform a systems biology analysis of the microbiome, metabolome and cognitive change after rifaximin in MHE. Methods Twenty cirrhotics with MHE underwent cognitive testing, endotoxin analysis, urine/serum metabolomics (GC and LC-MS) and fecal microbiome assessment (multi-tagged pyrosequencing) at baseline and 8 weeks post-rifaximin 550 mg BID. Changes in cognition, endotoxin, serum/urine metabolites (and microbiome were analyzed using recommended systems biology techniques. Specifically, correlation networks between microbiota and metabolome were analyzed before and after rifaximin. Results There was a significant improvement in cognition(six of seven tests improved,p<0.01) and endotoxemia (0.55 to 0.48 Eu/ml, p = 0.02) after rifaximin. There was a significant increase in serum saturated (myristic, caprylic, palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and eicosanoic) and unsaturated (linoleic, linolenic, gamma-linolenic and arachnidonic) fatty acids post-rifaximin. No significant microbial change apart from a modest decrease in Veillonellaceae and increase in Eubacteriaceae was observed. Rifaximin resulted in a significant reduction in network connectivity and clustering on the correlation networks. The networks centered on Enterobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Bacteroidaceae indicated a shift from pathogenic to beneficial metabolite linkages and better cognition while those centered on autochthonous taxa remained similar. Conclusions Rifaximin is associated with improved cognitive function and endotoxemia in MHE, which is accompanied by alteration of gut bacterial linkages with metabolites without significant change in microbial abundance.

Yet explanations have been shown to improve the transparency of a recommender system by justifying recommendations, and this in turn can enhance the user's trust in the recommendations. Hence, one main challenge in designing a recommender system is mitigating the trade-off between an explainable technique with moderate prediction accuracy and a more accurate technique with no explainable recommendations. In this paper, we focus on factorization models and further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content or user attributes. We propose an explainability constrained MF technique that computes the top-n recommendation list from items that are explainable. Experimental results show that our method is effective in generating accurate and explainable recommendations."

However, popular items that hold a lot of usage data are more easy to recommend and, thus, niche items are often excluded from the recommendations.

The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased difficulty of choosing from these sets. These findings were supported by behavioral measurements revealing intensified information search and increased acquisition times for these large attractive sets. Important implications of these findings for the design of recommender system user interfaces will be discussed."

However, such programs are used suboptimally. New approaches are needed to optimise the use of these programs.

The aim is threefold, to explore: (1) how recommender systems provide health recommendations, (2) to what extent recommender systems incorporate theoretical models and (3) how the use of recommender systems may enhance the usage of computer-tailored interventions. Methods A scoping review was conducted, using MEDLINE and ScienceDirect, to identify health recommender systems reported in studies between January 2007 and December 2017. Information was subsequently extracted to understand the potential benefits of recommender systems for computer-tailored digital health programs. Titles and abstracts of 1184 studies were screened for the full-text screening, in which two reviewers independently selected articles and systematically extracted data using a predefined extraction form. Results A total of 26 articles were included for data extraction. General characteristics were reported, with eight studies reporting hybrid filtering. A description of how each recommender system provides a recommendation is described; the majority of recommender systems used messages as recommendation. We identified the potential effects of recommender systems on efficiency, effectiveness, trustworthiness and enjoyment of the digital health program. Conclusions Incorporating a collaborative method with demographic filtering as a second step to knowledge-based filtering could potentially add value to traditional tailoring with regard to enhancing the user experience. This study illustrates how recommender systems, especially hybrid programs, may have the potential to bring tailored digital health forward."

This provides better recommendations than competing methods and gives an interpretable latent space for understanding patterns of readership. Further, we exploit stochastic variational inference to model massive real-world datasets. For example, we can fit CPTF to the full arXiv usage dataset, which contains over 43 million ratings and 42 million word counts, within a day.

Simple non-convex optimization algorithms are popular and effective in practice. Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithms converge from a good initial point, it remains unclear why random or arbitrary initialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convex objective function for \\textit{positive semidefinite} matrix completion has no spurious local minima --- all local minima must also be global. Therefore, many popular optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent can provably solve positive semidefinite matrix completion with \\textit{arbitrary} initialization in polynomial time.

We believe that our main proof strategy can be useful for understanding geometric properties of other statistical problems involving partial or noisy observations."

This evolution allows e-commerce sites to observe rich data about users. The majority of traditional recommender systems have focused on the macro interactions between users and items, i.e., the purchase history of a customer. However, within each macro interaction between a user and an item, the user actually performs a sequence of micro behaviors, which indicate how the user locates the item, what activities the user conducts on the item (e.g., reading the comments, carting, and ordering) and how long the user stays with the item. Such micro behaviors offer fine-grained and deep understandings about users and provide tremendous opportunities to advance recommender systems in e-commerce. However, exploiting micro behaviors for recommendations is rather limited, which motivates us to investigate e-commerce recommendations from a micro-behavior perspective in this paper. Particularly, we uncover the effects of micro behaviors on recommendations and propose an interpretable Recommendation framework RIB, which models inherently the sequence of mIcro Behaviors and their effects. Experimental results on datasets from a real e-commence site demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of micro behaviors for recommendations."

    "title": "Optimizing top-n collaborative filtering via dynamic negative item sampling",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering techniques rely on aggregated user preference data to make personalized predictions. In many cases, users are reluctant to explicitly express their preferences and many recommender systems have to infer them from implicit user behaviors, such as clicking a link in a webpage or playing a music track. The clicks and the plays are good for indicating the items a user liked (i.e., positive training examples), but the items a user did not like (negative training examples) are not directly observed. Previous approaches either randomly pick negative training samples from unseen items or incorporate some heuristics into the learning model, leading to a biased solution and a prolonged training period. In this paper, we propose to dynamically choose negative training samples from the ranked list produced by the current prediction model and iteratively update our model. The experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets show that our approach not only reduces the training time, but also leads to significant performance gains."

    "abstract": "Online consumers face complex purchase decisions due to the huge selection of products and the vast amount of information available. Online retailers therefore try to support consumer decision making by providing recommendations generated by previous consumers as well as recommendations generated by recommender systems. The goal of this study is to analyze the interplay between online consumer reviews and recommender systems and its effect on consumers' decision making. We experimentally manipulate the provision of online consumer reviews and provider-generated recommendations for high- and low-involvement products, as well as search and experience products. Using a representative sample of online consumers, we find that providing online consumer reviews does not necessarily have to be beneficial for an online retailer, as inconsistent recommendations do negatively influence consumers' purchase decisions. In addition, by providing positive opinions of previous customers in addition to a recommender system's recommendation, online retailers may increase the effectiveness of their recommender system. However, if a previous customer's recommendation contradicts that of a recommender system, positive consumer reviews may even have negative consequences for online retailers."

    "title": "Providing entertainment by content-based filtering and semantic reasoning in intelligent recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems arose in view of the information overload present in numerous domains. The so-called content-based recommenders offer products similar to those the users liked in the past. However, due to the use of syntactic similarity metrics, these systems elaborate overspecialized recommendations including products very similar to those the user already knows. In this paper, we present a strategy that overcomes overspecialization by applying reasoning techniques borrowed from the semantic Web. Thanks to the reasoning, our strategy discovers a huge amount of knowledge about the user's preferences, and compares them with available products in a more flexible way, beyond the conventional syntactic metrics. Our reasoning-based strategy has been implemented in a recommender system for interactive digital television, with which we checked that the proposed technique offers accurate enhanced suggestions that would go unnoticed in the traditional approaches."

    "title": "Towards Personalized Fairness based on Causal Notion",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are gaining increasing and critical impacts on human and society since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and decision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness problems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on items, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios. Therefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for users to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works on fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness. However, it is important to advance from associative fairness notions to causal fairness notions for assessing fairness more properly in recommender systems. Based on the above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized counterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we introduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations through adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings for recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve personalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized situations. Experiments on two real-world datasets with shallow and deep recommendation algorithms show that our method can generate fairer recommendations for users with a desirable recommendation performance."

These perceptions, however, may change with time as users gain first-hand experience with IT usage, which, in turn, may change their subsequent IT usage behavior. This paper elaborates how users' be liefs and attitudes change during the course of their IT usage, defines emergent constructs driving such change, and proposes a temporal model of belief and attitude change by drawing on expectation-disconfirmation theory and the extant IT usage literature. Student data from two longitudinal studies in end-user computing (computer-based training system usage) and system development (rapid application development software usage) contexts provided empirical support for the hypothesized model, demonstrated its generalizability across technologies and usage contexts, and allowed us to probe context-specific differences. Content analysis of qualitative data validated some of our quantitative results. We report that emergent factors such as disconfirmation and satisfaction are critical to understanding changes in IT users' beliefs and attitudes and recommend that they be included in future process models of IT usage."

    "abstract": "Along with the rapid expansion of digital music formats, managing and searching for songs has become significant. Though music information retrieval (MIR) techniques have been made successfully in last ten years, the development of music recommender systems is still at a very early stage. Therefore, this paper surveys a general framework and state-of-art approaches in recommending music. Two popular algorithms: collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based model (CBM), have been found to perform well. Due to the relatively poor experience in finding songs in long tail and the powerful emotional meanings in music, two user-centric approaches: context-based model and emotion-based model, have been paid increasing attention. In this paper, three key compo- nents in music recommender - user modelling, item profiling, and match algorithms are discussed. Six recommendation models and four potential issues towards user experience, are explained. However, subjective music recommendation system has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose a motivation-based model using the empirical studies of human behaviour, sports education, music psychology."

    "title": "Multiobjective Pareto-Efficient Approaches for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are quickly becoming ubiquitous in applications such as e-commerce, social media channels, and content providers, among others, acting as an enabling mechanism designed to overcome the information overload problem by improving browsing and consumption experience. A typical task in many recommender systems is to output a ranked list of items, so that items placed higher in the rank are more likely to be interesting to the users. Interestingness measures include how accurate, novel, and diverse are the suggested items, and the objective is usually to produce ranked lists optimizing one of these measures. Suggesting items that are simultaneously accurate, novel, and diverse is much more challenging, since this may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, in which the attempt to improve a measure further may result in worsening other measures. In this article, we propose new approaches for multiobjective recommender systems based on the concept of Pareto efficiency\u2014a state achieved when the system is devised in the most efficient manner in the sense that there is no way to improve one of the objectives without making any other objective worse off. Given that existing multiobjective recommendation algorithms differ in their level of accuracy, diversity, and novelty, we exploit the Pareto-efficiency concept in two distinct manners: (i) the aggregation of ranked lists produced by existing algorithms into a single one, which we call Pareto-efficient ranking, and (ii) the weighted combination of existing algorithms resulting in a hybrid one, which we call Pareto-efficient hybridization. Our evaluation involves two real application scenarios: music recommendation with implicit feedback (i.e., Last.fm) and movie recommendation with explicit feedback (i.e., MovieLens). We show that the proposed Pareto-efficient approaches are effective in suggesting items that are likely to be simultaneously accurate, diverse, and novel. We discuss scenarios where the system achieves high levels of diversity and novelty without compromising its accuracy. Further, comparison against multiobjective baselines reveals improvements in terms of accuracy (from 10.4% to 10.9%), novelty (from 5.7% to 7.5%), and diversity (from 1.6% to 4.2%)."

Most existing explainable recommender models regard user preferences as invariant to generate static explanations. However, in real scenarios, a user\u2019s preference is always dynamic, and she may be interested in different product features at different states. The mismatching between the explanation and user preference may degrade costumers\u2019 satisfaction, confidence and trust for the recommender system.&#x0D; With the desire to fill up this gap, in this paper, we build a novel Dynamic Explainable Recommender (called DER) for more accurate user modeling and explanations. In specific, we design a time-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) to model user dynamic preferences, and profile an item by its review information based on sentence-level convolutional neural network (CNN). By attentively learning the important review information according to the user current state, we are not only able to improve the recommendation performance, but also can provide explanations tailored for the users\u2019 current preferences. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our model for improving recommendation performance. And to evaluate the explainability of our model, we first present examples to provide intuitive analysis on the highlighted review information, and then crowd-sourcing based evaluations are conducted to quantitatively verify our model\u2019s superiority."

This article is specifically concerned with extreme right (ER) video content, portions of which contravene hate laws and are thus illegal in certain countries, which are recommended by YouTube to some users. We develop a categorization of this content based on various schema found in a selection of academic literature on the ER, which is then used to demonstrate the political articulations of YouTube\u2019s recommender system, particularly the narrowing of the range of content to which users are exposed and the potential impacts of this. For this purpose, we use two data sets of English and German language ER YouTube channels, along with channels suggested by YouTube\u2019s related video service. A process is observable whereby users accessing an ER YouTube video are likely to be recommended further ER content, leading to immersion in an ideological bubble in just a few short clicks.

This work describes evidence of a basic incompatibility between the properties of recommender system data sets and the assumptions required for valid estimation and evaluation of statistical models in the presence of missing data. We discuss the implications of this problem and describe extended modelling and evaluation frameworks that attempt to circumvent it.

    "title": "Exploration in Interactive Personalized Music Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Current music recommender systems typically act in a greedy manner by recommending songs with the highest user ratings. Greedy recommendation, however, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather information on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are potentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs to explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation. This article presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this exploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model that accounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A piecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference algorithm help to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit of our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and playlist generation. We demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed approach with simulation results and a user study."

Second, it proposes a new clinical scoring system (0-3) that describes the extent and severity of chronic GVHD for each organ or site at any given time, taking functional impact into account. Third, it proposes new guidelines for global assessment of chronic GVHD severity that are based on the number of organs or sites involved and the degree of involvement in affected organs (mild, moderate, or severe). Diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires the presence of at least 1 diagnostic clinical sign of chronic GVHD (e.g., poikiloderma or esophageal web) or the presence of at least 1 distinctive manifestation (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis sicca) confirmed by pertinent biopsy or other relevant tests (e.g., Schirmer test) in the same or another organ. Furthermore, other possible diagnoses for clinical symptoms must be excluded. No time limit is set for the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. The Working Group recognized 2 main categories of GVHD, each with 2 subcategories. The acute GVHD category is defined in the absence of diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and includes (1) classic acute GVHD occurring within 100 days after transplantation and (2) persistent, recurrent, or late acute GVHD (features of acute GVHD occurring beyond 100 days, often during withdrawal of immune suppression). The broad category of chronic GVHD includes (1) classic chronic GVHD (without features or characteristics of acute GVHD) and (2) an overlap syndrome in which diagnostic or distinctive features of chronic GVHD and acute GVHD appear together. It is currently recommended that systemic therapy be considered for patients who meet criteria for chronic GVHD of moderate to severe global severity."

    "abstract": "Recent neuropathologic autopsy studies found that 15 to 25% of elderly demented patients have Lewy bodies (LB) in their brainstem and cortex, and in hospital series this may constitute the most common pathologic subgroup after pure Alzheimer9s disease (AD).The Consortium on Dementia with Lewy bodies met to establish consensus guidelines for the clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and to establish a common framework for the assessment and characterization of pathologic lesions at autopsy. The importance of accurate antemortem diagnosis of DLB includes a characteristic and often rapidly progressive clinical syndrome, a need for particular caution with neuroleptic medication, and the possibility that DLB patients may be particularly responsive to cholinesterase inhibitors. We identified progressive disabling mental impairment progressing to dementia as the central feature of DLB. Attentional impairments and disproportionate problem solving and visuospatial difficulties are often early and prominent. Fluctuation in cognitive function, persistent well-formed visual hallucinations, and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism are core features with diagnostic significance in discriminating DLB from AD and other dementias. Appropriate clinical methods for eliciting these key symptoms are described. Brainstem or cortical LB are the only features considered essential for a pathologic diagnosis of DLB, although Lewy-related neurites, Alzheimer pathology, and spongiform change may also be seen. We identified optimal staining methods for each of these and devised a protocol for the evaluation of cortical LB frequency based on a brain sampling procedure consistent with CERAD. This allows cases to be classified into brainstem predominant, limbic (transitional), and neocortical subtypes, using a simple scoring system based on the relative distribution of semiquantitative LB counts. Alzheimer pathology is also frequently present in DLB, usually as diffuse or neuritic plaques, neocortical neurofibrillary tangles being much less common. The precise nosological relationship between DLB and AD remains uncertain, as does that between DLB and patients with Parkinson9s disease who subsequently develop neuropsychiatric features. Finally, we recommend procedures for the selective sampling and storage of frozen tissue for a variety of neurochemical assays, which together with developments in molecular genetics, should assist future refinements of diagnosis and classification. <b>NEUROLOGY 1996;47: </b> 1113-1124"

However, consumers currently struggle to evaluate the appropriateness of recommendations offered. With collaborative filtering, recommendations are based on people's ratings of items. In this paper, we propose that the usefulness of recommender systems can be improved by including more information about recommenders. We conducted a laboratory online experiment with 100 participants simulating a movie recommender system to determine how familiarity of the recommender, profile similarity between decision-maker and recommender, and rating overlap with a particular recommender influence the choices of decision-makers in such a context. While familiarity in this experiment did not affect the participants' choices, profile similarity and rating overlap had a significant influence. These results help us understand the decision-making processes in an online context and form the basis for user-centered social recommender system design."

These systems are achieving widespread success in e-commerce nowadays. The tremendous growth of customers and products poses some key challenges for collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems. These axe: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of customers and products, achieving high coverage in presence of data sparsity, and meeting the demands of widespread availability. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. \r\nIn this dissertation, we present our approaches to address three such research challenges\u2014sparsity, scalability, and distribution. For the first two challenges, we perform experiments on real-world data. Our experiments show improvements over the basic CF-based algorithm. For the third challenge, we provide a framework that can be extended to implement distributed recommender systems. \r\nWe tackle the sparsity problem in two ways\u2014by implementing a model for integrating content-based ratings into a CF system and by applying alternate algorithmic approaches to address sparsity. For the first approach, we apply semi-intelligent filtering agents that generate ratings by analyzing syntactic features of the item content. For the second approach, we apply singular value decomposition (SVD) based prediction algorithms and item-based CF algorithms. Our results suggest that both of these techniques are capable of addressing the sparsity issue. \r\nWe apply two different approaches to address the scalability issue\u2014by using dimensionality reduction for neighborhood formation and by using incremental model-based techniques. In the first approach, we use SVD based dimensionality reduction technique and a clustering based technique. In the second approach, we use SVD-based incremental technique, incremental item-based technique, and association rule-based technique. Our results suggest that these methods have potential for improving the scalability of recommender systems. \r\nWe address the distribution issue by analyzing different approaches to implement distributed CF-based recommender systems. We present a taxonomy of recommender system applications based on the relative relevance of geographically proximate and distant users and items. We present three distribution frameworks and an evaluation of each framework-application pair."

    "title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy in higher eukaryotes",
    "abstract": "Research in autophagy continues to accelerate,(1) and as a result many new scientists are entering the field. Accordingly, it is important to establish a standard set of criteria for monitoring macroautophagy in different organisms. Recent reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose.(2,3) There are many useful and convenient methods that can be used to monitor macroautophagy in yeast, but relatively few in other model systems, and there is much confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure macroautophagy in higher eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers of autophagosomes versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway; thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from fully functional autophagy that includes delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of the methods that can be used by investigators who are attempting to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as by reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that investigate these processes. This set of guidelines is not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to verify an autophagic response."

    "title": "ClustKNN: A Highly Scalable Hybrid Model- & Memory-Based CF Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF)-based recommender systems are indispensable tools to find items of interest from the unmanageable number of available items. Moreover, companies who deploy a CF-based recommender system may be able to increase revenue by drawing customers\u2019 attention to items that they are likely to buy. However, the sheer number of customers and items typical in e-commerce systems demand specially designed CF algorithms that can gracefully cope with the vast size of the data. Many algorithms proposed thus far, where the principal concern is recommendation quality, may be too expensive to operate in a large-scale system. We propose ClustKnn, a simple and intuitive algorithm that is well suited for large data sets. The method first compresses data tremendously by building a straightforward but ecient clustering model. Recommendations are then generated quickly by using a simple Nearest Neighbor-based approach. We demonstrate the feasibility of ClustKnn both analytically and empirically. We also show, by comparing with a number of other popular CF algorithms that, apart from being highly scalable and intuitive, ClustKnn provides very good recommendation accuracy as well."

    "title": "Context-Aware Recommendation Based On Review Mining",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RS) play an important role in many areas including targeted advertising, personalized marketing and information retrieval. In recent years, the importance of contextual information has attracted many researchers to focus on designing systems that produce personalized recommendations in accordance with available contextual information of users. Comparing with traditional RS which mainly utilize users\u2019 rating history, the context# aware recommender systems (CARS) can result in better performance in various applications. In this paper, we present a context#aware recommender system that extracts contextual information from a textual description of user current situation and use it in combination with user ratings history to compute a utility function over the set of items. The item utility shows how much it is preferable regarding user current context. In our system, the context inference is modeled as a supervised topic#modeling problem in which the set of categories for a contextual attribute constitutes the topic set. As an example application, we used our method to mine hidden contextual data from customers' reviews for hotels and use it to produce context#aware recommendations. Our evaluations suggest that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a standard kNN recommender system."

    "title": "Social collaborative filtering by trust",
    "abstract": "To accurately and actively provide users with their potentially interested information or services is the main task of a recommender system. Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely adopted recommender algorithms, whereas it is suffering the issues of data sparsity and cold start that will severely degrade quality of recommendations. To address such issues, this article proposes a novel method, trying to improve the performance of collaborative filtering recommendation by means of elaborately integrating twofold sparse information, the conventional rating data given by users and the social trust network among the same users. It is a model-based method adopting matrix factorization technique to map users into low-dimensional latent feature spaces in terms of their trust relationship, aiming to reflect users' reciprocal influence on their own opinions more reasonably. The validations against a real-world dataset show that the proposed method performs much better than state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for social collaborative filtering by trust."

    "title": "An Inherently Nonnegative Latent Factor Model for High-Dimensional and Sparse Matrices from Industrial Applications",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices are commonly encountered in many big-data-related and industrial applications like recommender systems. When acquiring useful patterns from them, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) models have proven to be highly effective owing to their fine representativeness of the nonnegative data. However, current NMF techniques suffer from: 1) inefficiency in addressing HiDS matrices; and 2) constraints in their training schemes. To address these issues, this paper proposes to extract nonnegative latent factors (NLFs) from HiDS matrices via a novel inherently NLF (INLF) model. It bridges the output factors and decision variables via a single-element-dependent mapping function, thereby making the parameter training unconstrained and compatible with general training schemes on the premise of maintaining the nonnegativity constraints. Experimental results on six HiDS matrices arising from industrial applications indicate that INLF is able to acquire NLFs from them more efficiently than any existing method does."

    "abstract": "Group recommendation, which makes recommendations to a group of users instead of individuals, has become increasingly important in both the workspace and people's social activities, such as brainstorming sessions for coworkers and social TV for family members or friends. Group recommendation is a challenging problem due to the dynamics of group memberships and diversity of group members. Previous work focused mainly on the content interests of group members and ignored the social characteristics within a group, resulting in suboptimal group recommendation performance.In this work, we propose a group recommendation method that utilizes both social and content interests of group members. We study the key characteristics of groups and propose (1) a group consensus function that captures the social, expertise, and interest dissimilarity among multiple group members; and (2) a generic framework that automatically analyzes group characteristics and constructs the corresponding group consensus function. Detailed user studies of diverse groups demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and the importance of incorporating both social and content interests in group recommender systems."

    "title": "Using Association Rules for Course Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Students often need guidance in choosing adequate courses to complete their academic degrees. Course recommender systems have been suggested in the literature as a tool to help students make informed course selections. Although a variety of techniques have been proposed in these course recommender systems, combining data mining with user ratings in order to improve the recommendation has never been done before. This paper presents RARE, a course Recommender system based on Association RulEs, which incorporates a data mining process together with user ratings in recommendation. Starting from a history of real data, it discovers significant rules that associate academic courses followed by former students. These rules are later used to infer recommendations. In order to benefit from the current students\u2019 opinions, RARE also offers to users the possibility to rate the recommendations, thus leading to an improvement of the rules. Therefore, RARE combines the benefits of both former students\u2019 experience and current students\u2019 ratings in order to recommend the most relevant courses to its users."

    "abstract": "With the advent and explosive growth of the Web over the past decade, recommender systems have become at the heart of the business strategies of e-commerce and Internet-based companies such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, Amazon, etc. Hence, the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms are highly valuable and play a vital role at the success of such businesses in reaching out to new users and promoting their services and products. With the aim of improving the recommendation performance of such an algorithm, this paper proposes a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. The \u00bf-means algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are both used to cluster similar users and reduce the dimensionality. It proposes and evaluates an effective two stage recommender system that can generate accurate and highly efficient recommendations. The experimental results show that this new method significantly improves the performance of the recommendation systems."

    "abstract": "Learning effective feature crosses is the key behind building recommender systems. However, the sparse and large feature space requires exhaustive search to identify effective crosses. Deep &amp; Cross Network (DCN) was proposed to automatically and efficiently learn bounded-degree predictive feature interactions. Unfortunately, in models that serve web-scale traffic with billions of training examples, DCN showed limited expressiveness in its cross network at learning more predictive feature interactions. Despite significant research progress made, many deep learning models in production still rely on traditional feed-forward neural networks to learn feature crosses inefficiently. In light of the pros/cons of DCN and existing feature interaction learning approaches, we propose an improved framework DCN-V2 to make DCN more practical in large-scale industrial settings. In a comprehensive experimental study with extensive hyper-parameter search and model tuning, we observed that DCN-V2 approaches outperform all the state-of-the-art algorithms on popular benchmark datasets. The improved DCN-V2 is more expressive yet remains cost efficient at feature interaction learning, especially when coupled with a mixture of low-rank architecture. DCN-V2 is simple, can be easily adopted as building blocks, and has delivered significant offline accuracy and online business metrics gains across many web-scale learning to rank systems at Google."

    "title": "Knowledge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Transformer Network for Multi-Behavior Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Accurate user and item embedding learning is crucial for modern recommender systems. However, most existing recommendation techniques have thus far focused on modeling users' preferences over singular type of user-item interactions. Many practical recommendation scenarios involve multi-typed user interactive behaviors (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite and purchase), which presents unique challenges that cannot be handled by current recommendation solutions. In particular: i) complex inter-dependencies across different types of user behaviors; ii) the incorporation of knowledge-aware item relations into the multi-behavior recommendation framework; iii) dynamic characteristics of multi-typed user-item interactions. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Transformer Network (KHGT), to investigate multi-typed interactive patterns between users and items in recommender systems. Specifically, KHGT is build upon a graph-structured neural architecture to i) capture type-specific behavior semantics; ii) explicitly discriminate which types of user-item interactions are more important in assisting the forecasting task on the target behavior. Additionally, we further integrate the multi-modal graph attention layer with temporal encoding strategy, to empower the learned embeddings be reflective of both dedicated multiplex user-item and item-item collaborative relations, as well as the underlying interaction dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that KHGT consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art recommendation methods across various evaluation settings. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/akaxlh/KHGT."

    "abstract": "In recent years, many systems have been developed which aim at helping users to find pieces of information or other objects that are in accordance with their personal interests. In these systems, machine learning methods are often used to acquire the user interest profile. Frequently user interests drift with time. The ability to adapt fast to the current user's interests is an feature for recommender systems. This paper presents a method for dealing with drifting interests by introducing the notion of gradual forgetting. Thus, the last observations should be more important for the learning algorithm than the old ones and the importance of an observation should decrease with time. The conducted experiments with a recommender system show that the gradual forgetting improves the ability to adapt to drifting user's interests. Experiments with the STAGGER problem provide additional evidences that gradual forgetting is able to improve the prediction accuracy on drifting concepts (incl. drifting user's interests)."

We then explain some results of these new trends in real-world applications through the smart prediction assistant (SPA) platform in an intelligent learning guide with more than three million users. While most approaches to recommending have focused on algorithm performance. SPA makes recommendations to users on the basis of emotional information acquired in an incremental way. This article provides a cross-disciplinary perspective to achieve this goal in such recommender systems through a SPA platform. The methodology applied in SPA is the result of a bunch of technology transfer projects for large real-world rccommender systems."

    "abstract": "Deep candidate generation (DCG) that narrows down the collection of relevant items from billions to hundreds via representation learning has become prevalent in industrial recommender systems. Standard approaches approximate maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) through sampling for better scalability and address the problem of DCG in a way similar to language modeling. However, live recommender systems face severe exposure bias and have a vocabulary several orders of magnitude larger than that of natural language, implying that MLE will preserve and even exacerbate the exposure bias in the long run in order to faithfully fit the observed samples. In this paper, we theoretically prove that a popular choice of contrastive loss is equivalent to reducing the exposure bias via inverse propensity weighting, which provides a new perspective for understanding the effectiveness of contrastive learning. Based on the theoretical discovery, we design CLRec, a contrastive learning method to improve DCG in terms of fairness, effectiveness and efficiency in recommender systems with extremely large candidate size. We further improve upon CLRec and propose Multi-CLRec, for accurate multi-intention aware bias reduction. Our methods have been successfully deployed in Taobao, where at least four-month online A/B tests and offline analyses demonstrate its substantial improvements, including a dramatic reduction in the Matthew effect."

    "abstract": "For a long time, different recommendation tasks require designing task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to transfer the knowledge and representations from one task to another, thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation approaches. To deal with such issues, considering that language can describe almost anything and language grounding is a powerful medium to represent various problems or tasks, we present a flexible and unified text-to-text paradigm called \u201cPretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Predict Paradigm\u201d (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various recommendation tasks in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item interactions, user descriptions, item metadata, and user reviews are converted to a common format \u2014 natural language sequences. The rich information from natural language assists P5 to capture deeper semantics for personalization and recommendation. Specifically, P5 learns different tasks with the same language modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it serves as the foundation model for various downstream recommendation tasks, allows easy integration with other modalities, and enables instruction-based recommendation. P5 advances recommender systems from shallow model to deep model to big model, and will revolutionize the technical form of recommender systems towards universal recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized prompt for different users, P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or few-shot manner and largely reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On several benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of P5. To help advance future research on Recommendation as Language Processing (RLP), Personalized Foundation Models (PFM), and Universal Recommendation Engine (URE), we release the source code, dataset, prompts, and pretrained P5 model at https://github.com/jeykigung/P5."

    "abstract": "In today's digital world, it has become an irksome task to find the content of one's liking in an endless variety of content that are being consumed like books, videos, articles, movies, etc. On the other hand there has been an emerging growth among the digital content providers who want to engage as many users on their service as possible for the maximum time. This gave birth to the recommender system comes wherein the content providers recommend users the content according to the users' taste and liking. In this paper we have proposed a movie recommendation system. A movie recommendation is important in our social life due to its features such as suggesting a set of movies to users based on their interest, or the popularities of the movies. In this paper we are proposing a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user as well as the other existing users. It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, which are required for recommendation. We use content-based and collaborative filtering and also hybrid filtering, which is a combination of the results of these two techniques, to construct a system that provides more precise recommendations concerning movies."

Predicting a user's rating on an item is the fundamental recommendation task. Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users."

However, current CF methods suffer from such problems as data sparsity, recommendation inaccuracy, and big-error in predictions. In this paper, we borrow ideas of object typicality from cognitive psychology and propose a novel typicality-based collaborative filtering recommendation method named TyCo. A distinct feature of typicality-based CF is that it finds \"neighbors\" of users based on user typicality degrees in user groups (instead of the corated items of users, or common users of items, as in traditional CF). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on investigating CF recommendation by combining object typicality. TyCo outperforms many CF recommendation methods on recommendation accuracy (in terms of MAE) with an improvement of at least 6.35 percent in Movielens data set, especially with sparse training data (9.89 percent improvement on MAE) and has lower time cost than other CF methods. Further, it can obtain more accurate predictions with less number of big-error predictions."

This dominant, albeit narrow, view of the recommendation problem has been tremendously helpful in advancing research in different ways, e.g., through the establishment of standardized evaluation procedures and metrics. In reality, recommender systems can serve a variety of purposes from the point of view of both consumers and providers. Most of the purposes, however, are significantly underexplored, even though many of them are arguably more aligned with the real-world expectations for recommenders than our current predominant paradigm. Therefore, it is important to revisit our conceptualizations of the potential goals of recommenders and their operationalization as research problems. In this paper, we discuss a framework of recommendation goals and purposes and highlight possible future directions and challenges related to the operationalization of such alternative problem formulations."

Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches."

    "title": "SDM",
    "abstract": "Capturing users' precise preferences is a fundamental problem in large-scale recommender system. Currently, item-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods are common matching approaches in industry. However, they are not effective to model dynamic and evolving preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a new sequential deep matching (SDM) model to capture users' dynamic preferences by combining short-term sessions and long-term behaviors. Compared with existing sequence-aware recommendation methods, we tackle the following two inherent problems in real-world applications: (1) there could exist multiple interest tendencies in one session. (2) long-term preferences may not be effectively fused with current session interests. Long-term behaviors are various and complex, hence those highly related to the short-term session should be kept for fusion. We propose to encode behavior sequences with two corresponding components: multi-head self-attention module to capture multiple types of interests and long-short term gated fusion module to incorporate long-term preferences. Successive items are recommended after matching between sequential user behavior vector and item embedding vectors. Offline experiments on real-world datasets show the superior performance of the proposed SDM. Moreover, SDM has been successfully deployed on online large-scale recommender system at Taobao and achieves improvements in terms of a range of commercial metrics."

Our hybrid approach, HyPER (HYbrid Probabilistic Extensible Recommender), incorporates and reasons over a wide range of information sources. Such sources include multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and social information. HyPER automatically learns to balance these different information signals when making predictions. We build our system using a powerful and intuitive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic, which enables efficient and accurate prediction by formulating our custom recommender systems with a scalable class of graphical models known as hinge-loss Markov random fields. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two popular recommendation datasets, showing that HyPER can effectively combine multiple information types for improved performance, and can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches."

These systems demonstrate improved accuracy compared to single-source recommendation strategies. However, hybrid recommendation strategies are inherently more complex than those that use a single source of information, and thus the process of explaining recommendations to users becomes more challenging. In this paper we describe a hybrid recommender system built on a probabilistic programming language, and discuss the benefits and challenges of explaining its recommendations to users. We perform a mixed model statistical analysis of user preferences for explanations in this system. Through an online user survey, we evaluate explanations for hybrid algorithms in a variety of text and visual, graph-based formats, that are either novel designs or derived from existing hybrid recommender systems."

    "title": "Reinforcement Learning based Recommender System using Biclustering Technique",
    "abstract": "A recommender system aims to recommend items that a user is interested in among many items. The need for the recommender system has been expanded by the information explosion. Various approaches have been suggested for providing meaningful recommendations to users. One of the proposed approaches is to consider a recommender system as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem and try to solve it using reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing RL-based methods have an obvious drawback. To solve an MDP in a recommender system, they encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring RL to a larger class of problems. In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based recommender system. We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space significantly. Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem. In addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system recommends certain items. Lastly, we examine the proposed algorithm on a real-world dataset and achieve a better performance than the widely used recommendation algorithm."

    "abstract": "Learning management systems (LMS) are typically used by large educational institutions and focus on supporting instructors in managing and administrating online courses. However, such LMS typically use a \"one size fits all\" approach without considering individual learner's profile. A learner's profile can, for example, consists of his/her learning styles, goals, prior knowledge, abilities, and interests. Generally, LMSs do not cater individual learners' needs based on their profile. However, considering learners' profiles can help in enhancing the learning experiences and performance of learners within the course. To support personalization in LMS, recommender systems can be used to recommend appropriate learning objects to learners to increase their learning. In this paper, we introduce the personalized learning object recommender system. The proposed system supports learners by providing them recommendations about which learning objects within the course are more useful for them, considering the learning object they are visiting as well as the learning objects visited by other learners with similar profiles. This kind of personalization can help in improving the overall quality of learning by providing recommendations of learning objects that are useful but were overlooked or intentionally skipped by learners. Such recommendations can increase learners' performance and satisfaction during the course."

    "title": "Automatic Recommendations for E-Learning Personalization Based on Web Usage Mining Techniques and Information Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Introduction Up to the very recent years, most e-learning systems have not been personalized. Several works have addressed the need for personalization in the e-learning domain. However, even today, personalization systems are still mostly confined to research labs, and most of the current e-learning platforms are still delivering the same educational resources in the same way to learners with different profiles. In general, to enable personalization, existing systems used one or more types of knowledge (learners' knowledge, learning material knowledge, learning process knowledge, etc). Generally, personalization in e-learning systems concerns: adaptive interaction, adaptive course delivery, content discovery and assembly, and adaptive collaboration support. The category of adaptive course delivery represents the most common and widely used collection of adaptation techniques applied in e-learning systems today. Typical examples include dynamic course re-structuring and adaptive selection of learning objects, as well as adaptive navigation support, which have all benefited from the rise of using recommendation strategies to generate new and relevant links and items. In fact, one of the new forms of personalization in e-learning environment is to give recommendations to learners in order to support and help them through the e-learning process. A number of personalized systems have relied on explicit information given by a learner (demographic, questionnaire, etc) and have applied known methods and techniques of adapting the presentation and navigation (Chorfi et al., 2004). As explained in (Brusilovsky, 1996), two different classes of adaptation can be considered: adaptive presentation and adaptive navigation support. Later, in (Brusilovsky, 2001), the taxonomy of adaptive hypermedia technologies was updated to add some extensions in relation with new technologies. Then, the distinction between two modes of adaptive navigation support became a necessity, especially with the growth of recommender systems. Automatic recommendation implies that the user profiles are created and eventually maintained dynamically by the system without explicit user information. Examples include amazon.com's personalized recommendations and music recommenders like Mystrand.com in commercial systems (Mobasher 2006), smart recommenders in e-learning (Zaiane, 2002), etc. In general, such systems differ in the input data, in user modeling strategies, and in prediction techniques. Several approaches for automatic personalization have been reported in the literature, such as content-based or item-based filtering, collaborative filtering, rule-based filtering, and techniques relying on Web usage mining, etc (Nasraoui, 2005). Web recommender systems can be categorized depending on these approaches. Content-based filtering (or item-based filtering) systems recommend items to a given user based on the correlation between the content of these items and the preferences of the user (Meteren et al., 2000). This means that the recommended items are considered to be similar to those seen and liked by the same user in the past. Thus, there is no notion of a community of users, rather only one user profile is considered while making recommendations. Classical examples of systems applying content based filtering approach include among other Personal webwatcher (Mladenic , 1996), syskill and webert (Pazzani et al., 1997), etc. Collaborative filtering system recommends items that are liked by other users with similar interests. Thus, the exploration of new items is assured by the fact that other similar user profiles are also considered. Examples of such systems include GroupLens (Konstan et al., 1997) and (Sarwar et al., 1998). Hybrid recommender systems combine several recommendation strategies to provide better performance than either strategy alone. Most hybrids work by combining several input data sources or several recommendation strategies. \u2026"

Practically, it plays an important role for CTR modeling in these applications by mining user interest from rich historical behavior data. Driven by the development of deep learning, deep CTR models with ingeniously designed architecture for user interest modeling have been proposed, bringing remarkable improvement of model performance over offline metric.However, great efforts are needed to deploy these complex models to online serving system for realtime inference, facing massive traffic request. Things turn to be more difficult when it comes to long sequential user behavior data, as the system latency and storage cost increase approximately linearly with the length of user behavior sequence. In this paper, we face directly the challenge of long sequential user behavior modeling and introduce our hands-on practice with the co-design of machine learning algorithm and online serving system for CTR prediction task. Theoretically, the co-design solution of UIC and MIMN enables us to handle the user interest modeling with unlimited length of sequential behavior data. Comparison between model performance and system efficiency proves the effectiveness of proposed solution. To our knowledge, this is one of the first industrial solutions that are capable of handling long sequential user behavior data with length scaling up to thousands. It now has been deployed in the display advertising system in Alibaba."

In this study, a structured survey concerning what recommender systems should contain and how this content should be presented was administered on 131 college-aged online shoppers. Results indicate participants prefer specific recommender content. Price, image and names of products are identified as essential information, while product promotions, customer ratings and feedback are identified as secondary types of information. Shoppers preferred short and relevant recommender information, with a maximum of three recommendations on one page.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings: a matrix factorization that exploits items' properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement. The experimental results on two item cold-start use cases: news recommendation and email recipient recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show that it significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art methods for item cold-start."

We devise efficient algorithms to translate an RBM into the commonly used TNS. Conversely, we give sufficient and necessary conditions to determine whether a TNS can be transformed into an RBM of given architectures. Revealing these general and constructive connections can cross-fertilize both deep learning and quantum many-body physics. Notably, by exploiting the entanglement entropy bound of TNS, we can rigorously quantify the expressive power of RBM on complex data sets. Insights into TNS and its entanglement capacity can guide the design of more powerful deep learning architectures. On the other hand, RBM can represent quantum many-body states with fewer parameters compared to TNS, which may allow more efficient classical simulations."

The energy consumption data of users are firstly collected from the smart meter, and then key energy consumption features of the users are extracted and stored into a user knowledge database (UKD), together with the information of their chosen electricity retail plans. For a target user, the recommender system analyzes his/her energy consumption pattern, find users having similar energy consumption patterns with him/her from the UKD, and then recommend most suitable pricing plan to the target user. Experiments are conducted based on actual smart meter data and retail plan data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed PRS."

    "abstract": "A common challenge for most current recommender systems is the cold-start problem. Due to the lack of user-item interactions, the fine-tuned recommender systems are unable to handle situations with new users or new items. Recently, some works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the recommendation scenarios, i.e. predicting the user preference by only a few of past interacted items. The core idea is learning a global sharing initialization parameter for all users and then learning the local parameters for each user separately. However, most meta-learning based recommendation approaches adopt model-agnostic meta-learning for parameter initialization, where the global sharing parameter may lead the model into local optima for some users. In this paper, we design two memory matrices that can store task-specific memories and feature-specific memories. Specifically, the feature-specific memories are used to guide the model with personalized parameter initialization, while the task-specific memories are used to guide the model fast predicting the user preference. And we adopt a meta-optimization approach for optimizing the proposed method. We test the model on two widely used recommendation datasets and consider four cold-start situations. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

The former refers to forums or E-commerce sites that emphasize user-item interactions, like Trip.com and Amazon; whereas the latter refers to social networking services (SNSs) that have rich user-user connections, such as Facebook and Twitter. Despite their heterogeneity, these two domains can be bridged by a few overlapping users, dubbed as bridge users. In this work, we address the problem of cross-domain social recommendation, i.e., recommending relevant items of information domains to potential users of social networks. To our knowledge, this is a new problem that has rarely been studied before. Existing cross-domain recommender systems are unsuitable for this task since they have either focused on homogeneous information domains or assumed that users are fully overlapped. Towards this end, we present a novel Neural Social Collaborative Ranking (NSCR) approach, which seamlessly sews up the user-item interactions in information domains and user-user connections in SNSs. In the information domain part, the attributes of users and items are leveraged to strengthen the embedding learning of users and items. In the SNS part, the embeddings of bridge users are propagated to learn the embeddings of other non-bridge users. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our NSCR method."

By conceptualizing the advice seeking and giving relationship as a fundamentally social process, important avenues for understanding the persuasiveness of recommender systems open up. Specifically, research regarding influential factors in advice seeking relationships, which is abundant in the context of human-human relationships, can provide an important framework for identifying potential influence factors in recommender system context. This book reviews the existing literature on the factors in advice seeking relationships in the context of human-human, human-computer, and human-recommender system interactions. It concludes that many social cues that have been identified as influential in other contexts have yet to be implemented and tested with respect to recommender systems.

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation -- collaborative filtering -- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance."

We follow an approach that exploits the geometry of the low-rank constraint to recast the problem as an unconstrained optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold. We then apply first- and second-order Riemannian trust-region methods to solve it. The cost of each iteration is linear in the number of known entries.

    "title": "Recommender System Rethink: Implications for an Electronic Marketplace with Competing Manufacturers",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems that inform consumers about their likely ideal products have become the cornerstone of e-commerce platforms that sell products from competing manufacturers. Using a model of an electronic marketplace in which two competing manufacturers sell their products through a common retail platform, we study the effect of recommender systems on the retail platform, manufacturers, consumer surplus, and social welfare. In our setting, consumers are differentiated with respect to their preference for the two products (locational differentiation) and awareness about the two products (informational differentiation). A recommender system selects the recommendation based on a recommendation score, which is a weighted sum of expected retailer profit and expected consumer value. We find that the recommender system may benefit or hurt the retailer and the manufacturers depending on the signs and magnitudes of the substitution effect and demand effect of the recommender system. The substitution effect of the recommender system either intensifies or softens the price competition between two manufacturers through two forces\u2014its direct influence alters the informational differentiation of consumers (which affects the markup that manufacturers can charge), and its strategic influence motivates the manufacturers to use price as a lever to attract more recommendations in their favor. The demand effect of the recommender system increases overall consumer awareness, but, depending on the substitution effect, may increase or decrease the demand. The recommendation strategy, namely, the relative weight assigned to retailer profit vis-\u00e1-vis consumer value in computing the recommendation score, along with recommender system precision and the relative sizes of segments of consumers with different awareness levels, determines whether the retailer benefits from the recommender system and by how much. We find that the retailer\u2019s optimal recommendation strategy is mildly profit oriented in the sense that it assigns a larger, but not too large, weight to retailer profit compared to consumer value, and that under the optimal strategy, the price competition is less intense and the retailer profit is higher compared to when there is no recommender system. Furthermore, an increase in either the recommender system precision or the fraction of consumers that are aware of at least one product induces the retailer to adopt a more profit-oriented recommendation strategy.

Borrowing ideas from the learning to rank community for web search, we propose novel models which approximately optimize NDCG for the recommendation task. Our models are essentially variations on matrix factorization models where we also additionally learn the features associated with the users and the items for the ranking task. Experimental results on a number of standard collaborative filtering data sets validate our claims. The results also show the accuracy and efficiency of our models and the benefits of learning features for ranking."

However, the Validation Project determined that the RDC/TMD Axis I validity was below the target sensitivity of \u2265 0.70 and specificity of \u2265 0.95. Consequently, these empirical results supported the development of revised RDC/TMD Axis I diagnostic algorithms that were subsequently demonstrated to be valid for the most common pain-related TMD and for one temporomandibular joint (TMJ) intra-articular disorder. The original RDC/TMD Axis II instruments were shown to be both reliable and valid. Working from these findings and revisions, two international consensus workshops were convened, from which recommendations were obtained for the finalization of new Axis I diagnostic algorithms and new Axis II instruments.Through a series of workshops and symposia, a panel of clinical and basic science pain experts modified the revised RDC/TMD Axis I algorithms by using comprehensive searches of published TMD diagnostic literature followed by review and consensus via a formal structured process. The panel's recommendations for further revision of the Axis I diagnostic algorithms were assessed for validity by using the Validation Project's data set, and for reliability by using newly collected data from the ongoing TMJ Impact Project-the follow-up study to the Validation Project. New Axis II instruments were identified through a comprehensive search of the literature providing valid instruments that, relative to the RDC/TMD, are shorter in length, are available in the public domain, and currently are being used in medical settings.The newly recommended Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) Axis I protocol includes both a valid screener for detecting any pain-related TMD as well as valid diagnostic criteria for differentiating the most common pain-related TMD (sensitivity \u2265 0.86, specificity \u2265 0.98) and for one intra-articular disorder (sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.97). Diagnostic criteria for other common intra-articular disorders lack adequate validity for clinical diagnoses but can be used for screening purposes. Inter-examiner reliability for the clinical assessment associated with the validated DC/TMD criteria for pain-related TMD is excellent (kappa \u2265 0.85). Finally, a comprehensive classification system that includes both the common and less common TMD is also presented. The Axis II protocol retains selected original RDC/TMD screening instruments augmented with new instruments to assess jaw function as well as behavioral and additional psychosocial factors. The Axis II protocol is divided into screening and comprehensive self report instrument sets. The screening instruments' 41 questions assess pain intensity, pain-related disability, psychological distress, jaw functional limitations, and parafunctional behaviors, and a pain drawing is used to assess locations of pain. The comprehensive instruments, composed of 81 questions, assess in further detail jaw functional limitations and psychological distress as well as additional constructs of anxiety and presence of comorbid pain conditions.The recommended evidence-based new DC/TMD protocol is appropriate for use in both clinical and research settings. More comprehensive instruments augment short and simple screening instruments for Axis I and Axis II. These validated instruments allow for identification of patients with a range of simple to complex TMD presentations."

Sorting out all this digital music is a very time-consuming and causes information fatigue. Therefore, it is very useful to develop a music recommender system that can search in the music libraries automatically and suggest suitable songs to users. By using music recommender system, the music provider can predict and then offer the appropriate songs to their users based on the characteristics of the music that has been heard previously. Our research would like to develop a music recommender system that can give recommendations based on similarity of features on audio signal. This study uses convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for feature extraction and similarity distance to look similarity between features. The results of this study indicate that users prefer recommendations that consider music genres compared to recommendations based solely on similarity."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are feedback loop systems, which often face bias problems such as popularity bias, previous model bias and position bias. In this paper, we focus on solving the bias problems in a recommender system via a uniform data. Through empirical studies in online and offline settings, we observe that simple modeling with a uniform data can alleviate the bias problems and improve the performance. However, the uniform data is always few and expensive to collect in a real product. In order to use the valuable uniform data more effectively, we propose a general knowledge distillation framework for counterfactual recommendation that enables uniform data modeling through four approaches: (1) label-based distillation focuses on using the imputed labels as a carrier to provide useful de-biasing guidance; (2) feature-based distillation aims to filter out the representative causal and stable features; (3) sample-based distillation considers mutual learning and alignment of the information of the uniform and non-uniform data; and (4) model structure-based distillation constrains the training of the models from the perspective of embedded representation. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and product datasets, demonstrating that the proposed four methods achieve better performance over the baseline models in terms of AUC and NLL. Moreover, we discuss the relation between the proposed methods and the previous works. We emphasize that counterfactual modeling with uniform data is a rich research area, and list some interesting and promising research topics worthy of further exploration.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of web services, effective QoS-based approach to service recommendation is becoming more and more important. Although service recommendation has been studied in the recent literature, the performance of existing ones is not satisfactory, since (1) previous approaches fail to consider the QoS variance according to users' locations; and (2) previous recommender systems are all black boxes providing limited information on the performance of the service candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering algorithm designed for large-scale web service recommendation. Different from previous work, our approach employs the characteristic of QoS and achieves considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy. To help service users better understand the rationale of the recommendation and remove some of the mystery, we use a recommendation visualization technique to show how a recommendation is grouped with other choices. Comprehensive experiments are conducted using more than 1.5 million QoS records of real-world web service invocations. The experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach."

    "title": "Item recommendation on monotonic behavior chains",
    "abstract": "'Explicit' and 'implicit' feedback in recommender systems have been studied for many years, as two relatively isolated areas. However many real-world systems involve a spectrum of both implicit and explicit signals, ranging from clicks and purchases, to ratings and reviews. A natural question is whether implicit signals (which are dense but noisy) might help to predict explicit signals (which are sparse but reliable), or vice versa. Thus in this paper, we propose an item recommendation framework which jointly models this full spectrum of interactions. Our main observation is that in many settings, feedback signals exhibit monotonic dependency structures, i.e., any signal necessarily implies the presence of a weaker (or more implicit) signal (a 'review' action implies a 'purchase' action, which implies a 'click' action, etc.). We refer to these structures as 'monotonic behavior chains,' for which we develop new algorithms that exploit these dependencies. Using several new and existing datasets that exhibit a variety of feedback types, we demonstrate the quantitative performance of our approaches. We also perform qualitative analysis to uncover the relationships between different stages of implicit vs. explicit signals."

Although many studies have been devoted to shilling attack detection, few of them can handle the hybrid shilling attacks that usually happen in practice, and the studies for real-life applications are rarely seen. Moreover, little attention has yet been paid to modeling both labeled and unlabeled user profiles, although there are often a few labeled but numerous unlabeled users available in practice. This paper presents a Hybrid Shilling Attack Detector, or HySAD for short, to tackle these problems. In particular, HySAD introduces MC-Relief to select effective detection metrics, and Semi-supervised Naive Bayes (SNB_lambda) to precisely separate Random-Filler model attackers and Average-Filler model attackers from normal users. Thorough experiments on MovieLens and Netflix datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HySAD in detecting hybrid shilling attacks, and its robustness for various obfuscated strategies. A real-life case study on product reviews of Amazon.cn is also provided, which further demonstrates that HySAD can effectively improve the accuracy of a collaborative-filtering based recommender system, and provide interesting opportunities for in-depth analysis of attacker behaviors. These, in turn, justify the value of HySAD for real-world applications."

However, most of the sentiment analysis-based restaurant recommender systems only use static information such as food quality, price, and service quality. The analysis of users\u2019 opinions and the extraction of their food preferences lead to the provision of personalized recommendations, which is a research gap in literature; In this paper, a context-aware recommender system is proposed that extracts the food preferences of individuals from their comments and suggests restaurants in accordance with these preferences. For this purpose, the semantic approach is used to cluster the name of foods extracted from users\u2019 comments and analyze their sentiments about them. Finally, nearby open restaurants are recommended based on their similarity to user preferences. For evaluation, the TripAdvisor website has been used and comments from 100 different users have been collected during the first 9 months of 2018. The precision, recall and f-measure of the system are measured in three scenarios of top1, top3, and top5. The results indicate that the proposed system can provide recommendations with a precision of 92.8%, giving users a high degree of precision. Besides, the system outperforms the previous research in these criteria. \u2022 A text processing method is proposed to extract users\u2019 preferences from their comments. \u2022 A restaurant recommender system is proposed based on semantic similarity evaluation. \u2022 The precision, recall and f-measure has been evaluated via an experiment."

    "abstract": "Model-based methods for recommender systems have been studied extensively in recent years. In systems with large corpus, however, the calculation cost for the learnt model to predict all user-item preferences is tremendous, which makes full corpus retrieval extremely difficult. To overcome the calculation barriers, models such as matrix factorization resort to inner product form (i.e., model user-item preference as the inner product of user, item latent factors) and indexes to facilitate efficient approximate k-nearest neighbor searches. However, it still remains challenging to incorporate more expressive interaction forms between user and item features, e.g., interactions through deep neural networks, because of the calculation cost. In this paper, we focus on the problem of introducing arbitrary advanced models to recommender systems with large corpus. We propose a novel tree-based method which can provide logarithmic complexity w.r.t. corpus size even with more expressive models such as deep neural networks. Our main idea is to predict user interests from coarse to fine by traversing tree nodes in a top-down fashion and making decisions for each user-node pair. We also show that the tree structure can be jointly learnt towards better compatibility with users' interest distribution and hence facilitate both training and prediction. Experimental evaluations with two large-scale real-world datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods. Online A/B test results in Taobao display advertising platform also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in production environments."

Adding a confidence metric has the potential to improve user satisfaction and alter user behavior in a recommender system. We performed an experiment to measure the effects of a confidence display as a component of an existing collaborative filteringbased recommender system. Minimal training improved use of the confidence display compared to no training. Novice users were less likely to notice, understand, and use the confidence display than experienced users of the system. Providing training about a confidence display to experienced users greatly reduced user satisfaction in the recommender system. These results raise interesting issues and demonstrate subtle effects about how and when to train users when adding features to a system."

Collaborative filtering (CF), as one of the most successful recommendation techniques, has been widely studied by various research institutions and industries and has been applied in practice. CF makes recommendations for the current active user using lots of users' historical rating information without analyzing the content of the information resource. However, in recent years, data sparsity and high dimensionality brought by big data have negatively affected the efficiency of the traditional CF-based recommendation approaches. In CF, the context information, such as time information and trust relationships among the friends, is introduced into RS to construct a training model to further improve the recommendation accuracy and user's satisfaction, and therefore, a variety of hybrid CF-based recommendation algorithms have emerged. In this paper, we mainly review and summarize the traditional CF-based approaches and techniques used in RS and study some recent hybrid CF-based recommendation approaches and techniques, including the latest hybrid memory-based and model-based CF recommendation algorithms. Finally, we discuss the potential impact that may improve the RS and future direction. In this paper, we aim at introducing the recent hybrid CF-based recommendation techniques fusing social networks to solve data sparsity and high dimensionality and provide a novel point of view to improve the performance of RS, thereby presenting a useful resource in the state-of-the-art research result for future researchers."

    "title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy",
    "abstract": "In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field."

    "title": "Collaborative Neural Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular techniques for building recommender systems. To overcome the data sparsity in CF, social recommender systems have emerged to boost recommendation performance by utilizing social correlation among users' interests. Recently, inspired by the immense success of deep learning for embedding learning, neural network-based recommender systems have shown promising recommendation performance. Nevertheless, few researchers have attempted to tackle the social recommendation problem with neural models. To this end, in this paper, we design a neural architecture that organically combines the intrinsic relationship between social network structure and user-item interaction behavior for social recommendation. Two key challenges arise in this process: first, how to incorporate the social correlation of users' interests in this neural model, and second, how to design a neural architecture to capture the unique characteristics of user-item interaction behavior for recommendation. To tackle these two challenges, we develop a model named collaborative neural social recommendation (CNSR) with two parts: 1) a social embedding part and 2) a collaborative neural recommendation (CNR) part. In CNSR, the user embedding leverages each user's social embedding learned from an unsupervised deep learning technique with social correlation regularization. The user and item embeddings are then fed into a unique neural network with a newly designed collaboration layer to model both the shallow collaborative and deep complex interaction relationships between users and items. We further propose a joint learning framework to allow the social embedding part and the CNR part to mutually enhance each other. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."

In the literature, two of the most popular approaches are based on factorization and graph-based models; the former approach captures user preferences by factorizing the observed direct interactions between users and items, and the latter extracts indirect preferences from the graphs constructed by user-item interactions. In this paper we present HOP-Rec, a unified and efficient method that incorporates the two approaches. The proposed method involves random surfing on a graph to harvest high-order information among neighborhood items for each user. Instead of factorizing a transition matrix, our method introduces a confidence weighting parameter to simulate all high-order information simultaneously, for which we maintain a sparse user-item interaction matrix and enrich the matrix for each user using random walks.

How to perform resource recommendation based on tagging data is an emerging research topic. In this paper we consider the problem of document (e.g. Web pages, research papers) recommendation using purely tagging data. That is, we only have data containing users, tags, documents and the relationships among them. We propose a novel graph-based representation learning algorithm for this purpose. The users, tags and documents are represented in the same semantic space in which two related objects are close to each other. For a given user, we recommend those documents that are sufficiently close to him/her. Experimental results on two data sets crawled from Del.icio.us and CiteULike show that our algorithm can generate promising recommendations and outperforms traditional recommendation algorithms."

    "title": "Socially-Aware Self-Supervised Tri-Training for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL), which can automatically generate ground-truth samples from raw data, holds vast potential to improve recommender systems. Most existing SSL-based methods perturb the raw data graph with uniform node/edge dropout to generate new data views and then conduct the self-discrimination based contrastive learning over different views to learn generalizable representations. Under this scheme, only a bijective mapping is built between nodes in two different views, which means that the self-supervision signals from other nodes are being neglected. Due to the widely observed homophily in recommender systems, we argue that the supervisory signals from other nodes are also highly likely to benefit the representation learning for recommendation. To capture these signals, a general socially-aware SSL framework that integrates tri-training is proposed in this paper. Technically, our framework first augments the user data views with the user social information. And then under the regime of tri-training for multi-view encoding, the framework builds three graph encoders (one for recommendation) upon the augmented views and iteratively improves each encoder with self-supervision signals from other users, generated by the other two encoders. Since the tri-training operates on the augmented views of the same data sources for self-supervision signals, we name it self-supervised tri-training. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets consistently validate the effectiveness of the self-supervised tri-training framework for improving recommendation.

    "abstract": "The seminal 2003 paper by Cosley, Lab, Albert, Konstan, and Reidl, demonstrated the susceptibility of recommender systems to rating biases. To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display average ratings before accepting ratings from users which has been shown to bias ratings. This effect is called Social Inuence Bias (SIB); the tendency to conform to the perceived \\norm\" in a community. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of SIB in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, we build a baseline dataset by allowing users to rate twice: before and after seeing the average rating. In the Analysis phase, we apply a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic to test whether the data is consistent with SIB. If significant, we propose a Mitigation phase using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict unbiased ratings. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 9390 ratings from the California Report Card (CRC), a rating-based system designed to encourage political engagement. We found statistically significant evidence of SIB. Mitigating models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8% and reduce bias by 76.3%.

    "abstract": "Although health outcomes have improved in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the past several decades, a new reality is at hand. Changing health needs, growing public expectations, and ambitious new health goals are raising the bar for health systems to produce better health outcomes and greater social value. But staying on current trajectory will not suffice to meet these demands. What is needed are high-quality health systems that optimise health care in each given context by consistently delivering care that improves or maintains health, by being valued and trusted by all people, and by responding to changing population needs. Quality should not be the purview of the elite or an aspiration for some distant future; it should be the DNA of all health systems. Furthermore, the human right to health is meaningless without good quality care because health systems cannot improve health without it. We propose that health systems be judged primarily on their impacts, including better health and its equitable distribution; on the confidence of people in their health system; and on their economic benefit, and processes of care, consisting of competent care and positive user experience. The foundations of high-quality health systems include the population and their health needs and expectations, governance of the health sector and partnerships across sectors, platforms for care delivery, workforce numbers and skills, and tools and resources, from medicines to data. In addition to strong foundations, health systems need to develop the capacity to measure and use data to learn. High-quality health systems should be informed by four values: they are for people, and they are equitable, resilient, and efficient. For this Commission, we examined the literature, analysed surveys, and did qualitative and quantitative research to evaluate the quality of care available to people in LMICs across a range of health needs included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explored the ethical dimensions of high-quality care in resource-constrained settings and reviewed available measures and improvement approaches. We reached five conclusions: Data from a range of countries and conditions show systematic deficits in quality of care. In LMICs, mothers and children receive less than half of recommended clinical actions in a typical preventive or curative visit, less than half of suspected cases of tuberculosis are correctly managed, and fewer than one in ten people diagnosed with major depressive disorder receive minimally adequate treatment. Diagnoses are frequently incorrect for serious conditions, such as pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and newborn asphyxia. Care can be too slow for conditions that require timely action, reducing chances of survival. At the system level, we found major gaps in safety, prevention, integration, and continuity, reflected by poor patient retention and insufficient coordination across platforms of care. One in three people across LMICs cited negative experiences with their health system in the areas of attention, respect, communication, and length of visit (visits of 5 min are common); on the extreme end of these experiences were disrespectful treatment and abuse. Quality of care is worst for vulnerable groups, including the poor, the less educated, adolescents, those with stigmatised conditions, and those at the edges of health systems, such as people in prisons. Universal health coverage (UHC) can be a starting point for improving the quality of health systems. Improving quality should be a core component of UHC initiatives, alongside expanding coverage and financial protection. Governments should start by establishing a national quality guarantee for health services, specifying the level of competence and user experience that people can expect. To ensure that all people will benefit from improved services, expansion should prioritise the poor and their health needs from the start. Progress on UHC should be measured through effective (quality-corrected) coverage. More than 8 million people per year in LMICs die from conditions that should be treatable by the health system. In 2015 alone, these deaths resulted in US$6 trillion in economic losses. Poor-quality care is now a bigger barrier to reducing mortality than insufficient access. 60% of deaths from conditions amenable to health care are due to poor-quality care, whereas the remaining deaths result from non-utilisation of the health system. High-quality health systems could prevent 2\u00b75 million deaths from cardiovascular disease, 1 million newborn deaths, 900 000 deaths from tuberculosis, and half of all maternal deaths each year. Quality of care will become an even larger driver of population health as utilisation of health systems increases and as the burden of disease shifts to more complex conditions. The high mortality rates in LMICs for treatable causes, such as injuries and surgical conditions, maternal and newborn complications, cardiovascular disease, and vaccine preventable diseases, illustrate the breadth and depth of the health-care quality challenge. Poor-quality care can lead to other adverse outcomes, including unnecessary health-related suffering, persistent symptoms, loss of function, and a lack of trust and confidence in health systems. Waste of resources and catastrophic expenditures are economic side effects of poor-quality health systems. As a result of this, only one-quarter of people in LMICs believe that their health systems work well. Measurement is key to accountability and improvement, but available measures do not capture many of the processes and outcomes that matter most to people. At the same time, data systems generate many metrics that produce inadequate insight at a substantial cost in funds and health workers' time. For example, although inputs such as medicines and equipment are commonly counted in surveys, these are weakly related to the quality of care that people receive. Indicators such as proportion of births with skilled attendants do not reflect quality of childbirth care and might lead to false complacency about progress in maternal and newborn health. This Commission calls for fewer, but better, measures of health system quality to be generated and used at national and subnational levels. Countries should report health system performance to the public annually by use of a dashboard of key metrics (eg, health outcomes, people's confidence in the system, system competence, and user experience) along with measures of financial protection and equity. Robust vital registries and trustworthy routine health information systems are prerequisites for good performance assessment. Countries need agile new surveys and real-time measures of health facilities and populations that reflect the health systems of today and not those of the past. To generate and interpret data, countries need to invest in national institutions and professionals with strong quantitative and analytical skills. Global development partners can support the generation and testing of public goods for health system measurement (civil and vital registries, routine data systems, and routine health system surveys) and promote national and regional institutions and the training and mentoring of scientists. Data on care quality in LMICs do not reflect the current disease burden. In many of these countries, we know little about quality of care for respiratory diseases, cancer, mental health, injuries, and surgery, as well as the care of adolescents and elderly people. There are vast blind spots in areas such as user experience, system competence, confidence in the system, and the wellbeing of people, including patient-reported outcomes. Measuring the quality of the health system as a whole and across the care continuum is essential, but not done. Filling in these gaps will require not only better routine health information systems for monitoring, but also new research, as proposed in the research agenda of this Commission. For example, research will be needed to rigorously evaluate the effects and costs of recommended improvement approaches on health, patient experience, and financial protection. Implementation science studies can help discern the contextual factors that promote or hinder reform. New data collection and research should be explicitly designed to build national and regional research capacity. To address the scale and range of quality deficits we documented in this Commission, reforming the foundations of the health system is required. Because health systems are complex adaptive systems that function at multiple interconnected levels, fixes at the micro-level (ie, health-care provider or clinic) alone are unlikely to alter the underlying performance of the whole system. However, we found that interventions aimed at changing provider behaviour dominate the improvement field, even though many of these interventions have a modest effect on provider performance and are difficult to scale and sustain over time. Achieving high-quality health systems requires expanding the space for improvement to structural reforms that act on the foundations of the system. This Commission endorses four universal actions to raise quality across the health system. First, health system leaders need to govern for quality by adopting a shared vision of quality care, a clear quality strategy, strong regulation, and continuous learning. Ministries of health cannot accomplish this alone and need to partner with the private sector, civil society, and sectors outside of health care, such as education, infrastructure, communication, and transport. Second, countries should redesign service delivery to maximise health outcomes rather than geographical access to services alone. Primary care could tackle a greater range of low-acuity conditions, whereas hospitals or specialised health centres should provide care for conditions, such as births, that need advanced clinical expertise or have the risk of unexpected complications. Third, countries should transform the health workforce by adopting competency-based clinical education, introducing training in ethics and respectful care, and better supporting and respecting all workers to deliver the best care possible. Fourth, governments and civil society should ignite demand for quality in the population to empower people to hold systems accountable and actively seek high-quality care. Additional targeted actions in areas such as health financing, management, district-level learning, and others can complement these efforts. What works in one setting might not work elsewhere, and improvement efforts should be adapted for local context and monitored. Funders should align their support with system-wide strategies rather than contribute to the proliferation of micro-level efforts. In this Commission, we assert that providing health services without guaranteeing a minimum level of quality is ineffective, wasteful, and unethical. Moving to a high-quality health system\u2014one that improves health and generates confidence and economic benefits\u2014is primarily a political, not technical, decision. National governments need to invest in high-quality health systems for their own people and make such systems accountable to people through legislation, education about rights, regulation, transparency, and greater public participation. Countries will know that they are on the way towards a high-quality, accountable health system when health workers and policymakers choose to receive health care in their own public institutions."

    "abstract": "To develop a knowledge-aware recommender system, a key issue is how to obtain rich and structured knowledge base (KB) information for recommender system (RS) items. Existing data sets or methods either use side information from original RSs (containing very few kinds of useful information) or utilize a private KB. In this paper, we present KB4Rec v1.0, a data set linking KB information for RSs. It has linked three widely used RS data sets with two popular KBs, namely Freebase and YAGO. Based on our linked data set, we first preform qualitative analysis experiments, and then we discuss the effect of two important factors (i.e., popularity and recency) on whether a RS item can be linked to a KB entity. Finally, we compare several knowledge-aware recommendation algorithms on our linked data set."

    "title": "Collaborative competitive filtering",
    "abstract": "While a user's preference is directly reflected in the interactive choice process between her and the recommender, this wealth of information was not fully exploited for learning recommender models. In particular, existing collaborative filtering (CF) approaches take into account only the binary events of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users' decisions are made. In this paper, we propose Collaborative Competitive Filtering (CCF), a framework for learning user preferences by modeling the choice process in recommender systems. CCF employs a multiplicative latent factor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike CF, CCF models the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In this way, CCF allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped together with missing data in existing CF models. We present two formulations and an efficient large scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on three real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that CCF significantly outperforms standard CF approaches in both offline and online evaluations."

    "title": "The Unfairness of Popularity Bias in Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are known to suffer from the popularity bias problem: popular (i.e. frequently rated) items get a lot of exposure while less popular ones are under-represented in the recommendations. Research in this area has been mainly focusing on finding ways to tackle this issue by increasing the number of recommended long-tail items or otherwise the overall catalog coverage. In this paper, however, we look at this problem from the users' perspective: we want to see how popularity bias causes the recommendations to deviate from what the user expects to get from the recommender system. We define three different groups of users according to their interest in popular items (Niche, Diverse and Blockbuster-focused) and show the impact of popularity bias on the users in each group. Our experimental results on a movie dataset show that in many recommendation algorithms the recommendations the users get are extremely concentrated on popular items even if a user is interested in long-tail and non-popular items showing an extreme bias disparity."

    "title": "Deep social collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are crucial to alleviate the information overload problem in online worlds. Most of the modern recommender systems capture users' preference towards items via their interactions based on collaborative filtering techniques. In addition to the user-item interactions, social networks can also provide useful information to understand users' preference as suggested by the social theories such as homophily and influence. Recently, deep neural networks have been utilized for social recommendations, which facilitate both the user-item interactions and the social network information. However, most of these models cannot take full advantage of the social network information. They only use information from direct neighbors, but distant neighbors can also provide helpful information. Meanwhile, most of these models treat neighbors' information equally without considering the specific recommendations. However, for a specific recommendation case, the information relevant to the specific item would be helpful. Besides, most of these models do not explicitly capture the neighbor's opinions to items for social recommendations, while different opinions could affect the user differently. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose DSCF, a Deep Social Collaborative Filtering framework, which can exploit the social relations with various aspects for recommender systems. Comprehensive experiments on two-real world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

Phys. Chem. Ref Data 21, 411 (1992); 23, 847 (1994)]. The work has been carried out under the auspices of the IUPAC Commission on Chemical Kinetics and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Individual data sheets are presented for most reactions but the kinetic data for reactions of C2, C, ethyl, i-propyl, t-butyl, and allyl radicals are summarized in tables. Each data sheet sets out relevant thermodynamic data, experimental kinetic data, references, recommended rate parameters with their error limits and a brief discussion of the reasons for their selection. Where appropriate the data are displayed on an Arrhenius diagram or by fall-off curves. Tables summarizing the recommended rate data and the thermodynamic data for the reactant and product species are given, and their sources referenced. As in the previous evaluations the reactions considered relate largely to the combustion in air of organic compounds containing up to three carbon atoms and simple aromatic compounds. Thus the data base has been expanded, largely by dealing with a substantial number of extra reactions within these general areas."

    "title": "Multidimensional Social Network in the Social Recommender System",
    "abstract": "All online sharing systems gather data that reflects users' collective behavior and their shared activities. This data can be used to extract different kinds of relationships which can be grouped into layers and which are basic components of the multidimensional social network (MSN) proposed in the paper. The layers are created on the basis of two types of relations between humans, i.e., direct and object-based ones which, respectively, correspond to either social or semantic links between individuals. For better understanding of the complexity of the social network structure, layers and their profiles were identified and studied on two, spanned in time, snapshots of the `Flickr' population. Additionally, for each layer, a separate strength measure was proposed. The experiments on the `Flickr' photo sharing system revealed that the relationships between users result either from semantic links between objects they operate on or from social connections of these users. Moreover, the density of the social network increases in time. The second part of this paper is devoted to building a social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations between users in a multimedia sharing system. Its main goal is to generate personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users' needs depending on the personal weights assigned to each layer in the MSN. The conducted experiments confirmed the usefulness of the proposed model."

    "title": "The Connection Between Popularity Bias, Calibration, and Fairness in Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recently there has been a growing interest in fairness-aware recommender systems including fairness in providing consistent performance across different users or groups of users. A recommender system could be considered unfair if the recommendations do not fairly represent the tastes of a certain group of users while other groups receive recommendations that are consistent with their preferences. In this paper, we use a metric called miscalibration for measuring how a recommendation algorithm is responsive to users' true preferences and we consider how various algorithms may result in different degrees of miscalibration for different users. In particular, we conjecture that popularity bias which is a well-known phenomenon in recommendation is one important factor leading to miscalibration in recommendation. Our experimental results using two real-world datasets show that there is a connection between how different user groups are affected by algorithmic popularity bias and their level of interest in popular items. Moreover, we show that the more a group is affected by the algorithmic popularity bias, the more their recommendations are miscalibrated."

    "abstract": "Items in real-world recommender systems exhibit certain hierarchical structures. Similarly, user preferences also present hierarchical structures. Recent studies show that incorporating the explicit hierarchical structures of items or user preferences can improve the performance of recommender systems. However, explicit hierarchical structures are usually unavailable, especially those of user preferences. Thus, there's a gap between the importance of hierarchical structures and their availability. In this paper, we investigate the problem of exploring the implicit hierarchical structures for recommender systems when they are not explicitly available. We propose a novel recommendation framework HSR to bridge the gap, which enables us to capture the implicit hierarchical structures of users and items simultaneously. Experimental results on two real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

In that field, collaborative filtering approaches can be distinguished from content-based ones. The former is based on a set of user ratings on items, while the latter uses item content descriptions and user thematic profiles. While collaborative filtering systems often result in better predictive performance, content-based filtering offers solutions to the limitations of collaborative filtering, as well as a natural way to interact with users. These complementary approaches thus motivate the design of hybrid systems. In this chapter, the main algorithmic methods used for recommender systems are presented in a state of the art. The evaluation of recommender systems is currently an important issue. The authors focus on two kinds of evaluations. The first one concerns the performance accuracy: several approaches are compared through experiments on two real movies rating datasets MovieLens and Netflix. The second concerns user satisfaction and for this a hybrid system is implemented and tested with real users."

In this paper, we propose a new framework for context-aware recommendation of visual documents by modeling the user needs, the context and also the visual document collection together in a unified model. We address also the user's need for diversified recommendations. Our pilot study showed the merits of our approach in content based image retrieval."

However, their practical applicability has been largely confined to scenarios\nwhere information relevant for recommendation making is kept in one single, authoritative node. Recently, novel distributed infrastructures are emerging, e.g., peer-to-peer networks and the Semantic Web, which could likewise benefit from recommender system services, leading to a paradigm shift towards decentralized recommender systems. In this book, we investigate the challenges that decentralized recommenders bring up and propose techniques to cope with those issues. The spectrum ranges from the use of product classification taxonomies, alleviating the sparsity problem, to trust propagation mechanisms designed to address the scalability issue. Empirical investigations on the correlation of interpersonal trust and interest similarity provide the component glue that melds these results. The book is geared towards academic readers and practitioners alike, with a focus on both implementable algorithms as well as new socio-psychological insights."

The model embeds a large set of applications ranging from sponsored-search advertising to credit scores to information sharing among competitors. We then zoom in to one of the critical elements in the markets for information: the design of the information. We distinguish between ex ante sales of information (the buyer acquires an information structure) and ex post sales (the buyer pays for specific realizations). We relate this distinction to the different products that brokers, advertisers, and publishers use to trade consumer information online. We discuss the endogenous limits to the trade of information that derive from the potential adverse use of information to the consumers. Finally, we discuss recommender systems and other information filtering systems that use artificial intelligence to predict ratings or preferences in markets for indirect information."

This source of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems while it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets."

    "title": "Attack resistant collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit.While previous research has attempted to study the robustness of various existing Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches, this remains an unsolved problem. Approaches such as Neighbor Selection algorithms, Association Rules and Robust Matrix Factorization have produced unsatisfactory results. This work describes a new collaborative algorithm based on SVD which is accurate as well as highly stable to shilling. This algorithm exploits previously established SVD based shilling detection algorithms, and combines it with SVD based-CF. Experimental results show a much diminished effect of all kinds of shilling attacks. This work also offers significant improvement over previous Robust Collaborative Filtering frameworks."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become prosperous nowadays, designed to predict users\u2019 potential interests in items by learning embeddings. Recent developments of the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) also provide recommender systems (RSs) with powerful backbones to learn embeddings from a user-item graph. However, only leveraging the user-item interactions suffers from the cold-start issue due to the difficulty in data collection. Hence, current endeavors propose fusing social information with user-item interactions to alleviate it, which is the social recommendation problem. Existing work employs GNNs to aggregate both social links and user-item interactions simultaneously. However, they all require centralized storage of the social links and item interactions of users, which leads to privacy concerns. Additionally, according to strict privacy protection under General Data Protection Regulation, centralized data storage may not be feasible in the future, urging a decentralized framework of social recommendation. As a result, we design a federated learning recommender system for the social recommendation task, which is rather challenging because of its heterogeneity, personalization, and privacy protection requirements. To this end, we devise a novel framework Fe drated So cial recommendation with G raph neural network ( FeSoG ). Firstly, FeSoG adopts relational attention and aggregation to handle heterogeneity. Secondly, FeSoG infers user embeddings using local data to retain personalization. Last but not least, the proposed model employs pseudo-labeling techniques with item sampling to protect the privacy and enhance training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets justify the effectiveness of FeSoG in completing social recommendation and privacy protection. We are the first work proposing a federated learning framework for social recommendation to the best of our knowledge."

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for nonlinear processing of graph signals, exhibiting success in recommender systems, power outage prediction, and motion planning, among others. GNNs consist of a cascade of layers, each of which applies a graph convolution, followed by a pointwise nonlinearity. In this work, we study the impact that changes in the underlying topology have on the output of the GNN. First, we show that GNNs are permutation equivariant, which implies that they effectively exploit internal symmetries of the underlying topology. Then, we prove that graph convolutions with integral Lipschitz filters, in combination with the frequency mixing effect of the corresponding nonlinearities, yields an architecture that is both stable to small changes in the underlying topology, and discriminative of information located at high frequencies. These are two properties that cannot simultaneously hold when using only linear graph filters, which are either discriminative or stable, thus explaining the superior performance of GNNs."

    "title": "Stability of Recommendation Algorithms",
    "abstract": "The article explores stability as a new measure of recommender systems performance. Stability is defined to measure the extent to which a recommendation algorithm provides predictions that are consistent with each other. Specifically, for a stable algorithm, adding some of the algorithm\u2019s own predictions to the algorithm\u2019s training data (for example, if these predictions were confirmed as accurate by users) would not invalidate or change the other predictions. While stability is an interesting theoretical property that can provide additional understanding about recommendation algorithms, we believe stability to be a desired practical property for recommender systems designers as well, because unstable recommendations can potentially decrease users\u2019 trust in recommender systems and, as a result, reduce users\u2019 acceptance of recommendations. In this article, we also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of stability for six popular recommendation algorithms on four real-world datasets. Our results suggest that stability performance of individual recommendation algorithms is consistent across a variety of datasets and settings. In particular, we find that model-based recommendation algorithms consistently demonstrate higher stability than neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques. In addition, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis of many important factors (e.g., the sparsity of original rating data, normalization of input data, the number of new incoming ratings, the distribution of incoming ratings, the distribution of evaluation data, etc.) and report the impact they have on recommendation stability."

    "abstract": "Most existing recommender systems leverage user behavior data of one type only, such as the purchase behavior in E-commerce that is directly related to the business Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of conversion rate. Besides the key behavioral data, we argue that other forms of user behaviors also provide valuable signal, such as views, clicks, adding a product to shopping carts and so on. They should be taken into account properly to provide quality recommendation for users. In this work, we contribute a new solution named short for Neural Multi-Task Recommendation (NMTR) for learning recommender systems from user multi-behavior data. We develop a neural network model to capture the complicated and multi-type interactions between users and items. In particular, our model accounts for the cascading relationship among different types of behaviors (e.g., a user must click on a product before purchasing it). To fully exploit the signal in the data of multiple types of behaviors, we perform a joint optimization based on the multi-task learning framework, where the optimization on a behavior is treated as a task. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that NMTR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems that are designed to learn from both single-behavior data and multi-behavior data. Further analysis shows that modeling multiple behaviors is particularly useful for providing recommendation for sparse users that have very few interactions."

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) recently has spurred a fruitful line of research in the field of recommendation, since its ability to extract self-supervised signals from the raw data is well-aligned with recommender systems' needs for tackling the data sparsity issue. A typical pipeline of CL-based recommendation models is first augmenting the user-item bipartite graph with structure perturbations, and then maximizing the node representation consistency between different graph augmentations. Although this paradigm turns out to be effective, what underlies the performance gains is still a mystery. In this paper, we first experimentally disclose that, in CL-based recommendation models, CL operates by learning more uniform user/item representations that can implicitly mitigate the popularity bias. Meanwhile, we reveal that the graph augmentations, which used to be considered necessary, just play a trivial role. Based on this finding, we propose a simple CL method which discards the graph augmentations and instead adds uniform noises to the embedding space for creating contrastive views. A comprehensive experimental study on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that, though it appears strikingly simple, the proposed method can smoothly adjust the uniformity of learned representations and has distinct advantages over its graph augmentation-based counterparts in terms of recommendation accuracy and training efficiency.

    "abstract": "The recently proposed extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) offers new opportunities for exploring the acceptance of consumer technologies. This study utilizes UTAUT2 to explore the user acceptance of social recommender systems that have become more attractive owing to improved content personalization and adaptation to user preferences. Scholars have shown that these systems could improve a recommendation's accuracy. However, the UTAUT2's applicability and the explanation of performance expectancy for social recommender systems are still unclear. We developed a UTAUT2-based framework and tested it in a quantitative study with 266 participants. The structural equation model results show that UTAUT2 is applicable in the context of social recommender systems. Furthermore, the user's social network information, profile information, and reading behavior positively influence performance expectancy and the intention to adopt a social recommender system. Therefore, incorporating social information might overcome the shortcomings of other classic recommender systems."

    "abstract": "1 Please direct correspondence to mobasher@cs.depaul.edu Abstract: Web usage mining, possibly used in conjunction with standard approaches to personalization such as collaborative filtering, can help address some of the shortcomings of these techniques, including reliance on subjective user ratings, lack of scalability, and poor performance in the face highdimensional and sparse data. However, the discovery of patterns from usage data by itself is not sufficient for performing the personalization tasks. The critical step is the effective derivation of good quality and useful (i.e., actionable) usage from these patterns. In this paper we present and experimentally evaluate two techniques, based on clustering of user transactions and clustering of pageviews, in order to discover overlapping aggregate profiles that can be effectively used by recommender systems for real-time personalization. We evaluate these techniques both in terms of the quality of the individual profiles generated, as well as in the context of providing recommendations as an integrated part of a personalization engine."

    "abstract": "Rankings of people and items are at the heart of selection-making, match-making, and recommender systems, ranging from employment sites to sharing economy platforms. As ranking positions influence the amount of attention the ranked subjects receive, biases in rankings can lead to unfair distribution of opportunities and resources such as jobs or income. This paper proposes new measures and mechanisms to quantify and mitigate unfairness from a bias inherent to all rankings, namely, the position bias which leads to disproportionately less attention being paid to low-ranked subjects. Our approach differs from recent fair ranking approaches in two important ways. First, existing works measure unfairness at the level of subject groups while our measures capture unfairness at the level of individual subjects, and as such subsume group unfairness. Second, as no single ranking can achieve individual attention fairness, we propose a novel mechanism that achieves amortized fairness, where attention accumulated across a series of rankings is proportional to accumulated relevance. We formulate the challenge of achieving amortized individual fairness subject to constraints on ranking quality as an online optimization problem and show that it can be solved as an integer linear program. Our experimental evaluation reveals that unfair attention distribution in rankings can be substantial, and demonstrates that our method can improve individual fairness while retaining high ranking quality."

As the reach of recommender systems has extended, it has become apparent that the single-minded focus on the user common to academic research has obscured other important aspects of recommendation outcomes. Properties such as fairness, balance, profitability, and reciprocity are not captured by typical metrics for recommender system evaluation. The concept of multistakeholder recommendation has emerged as a unifying framework for describing and understanding recommendation settings where the end user is not the sole focus. This article describes the origins of multistakeholder recommendation, and the landscape of system designs. It provides illustrative examples of current research, as well as outlining open questions and research directions for the field."

    "abstract": "The literature on recommender systems distinguishes typically between two broad categories of measuring recommendation accuracy: rating prediction, often quantified in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), and ranking, measured in terms of metrics like precision and recall, among others. In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item."

This setting has been considered by many methods, which however have a common problem of allowing to have only one similarity matrix over drugs and that over targets. The key idea of our approach is to use more than one similarity matrices over drugs as well as those over targets, where weights over the multiple similarity matrices are estimated from data to automatically select similarities, which are effective for improving the performance of predicting drug-target interactions. We propose a factor model, named Multiple Similarities Collaborative Matrix Factorization(MSCMF), which projects drugs and targets into a common low-rank feature space, which is further consistent with weighted similarity matrices over drugs and those over targets. These two low-rank matrices and weights over similarity matrices are estimated by an alternating least squares algorithm. Our approach allows to predict drug-target interactions by the two low-rank matrices collaboratively and to detect similarities which are important for predicting drug-target interactions. This approach is general and applicable to any binary relations with similarities over elements, being found in many applications, such as recommender systems. In fact, MSCMF is an extension of weighted low-rank approximation for one-class collaborative filtering. We extensively evaluated the performance of MSCMF by using both synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results showed nice properties of MSCMF on selecting similarities useful in improving the predictive performance and the performance advantage of MSCMF over six state-of-the-art methods for predicting drug-target interactions."

    "abstract": "Personalized recommender systems are important to assist user decision-making in the era of information overload. Meanwhile, explanations of the recommendations further help users to better understand the recommended items so as to make informed choices, which gives rise to the importance of explainable recommendation research. Textual sentence-based explanation has been an important form of explanations for recommender systems due to its advantage in communicating rich information to users. However, current approaches to generating sentence explanations are either limited to predefined sentence templates, which restricts the sentence expressiveness, or opt for free-style sentence generation, which makes it difficult for sentence quality control. In an attempt to benefit both sentence expressiveness and quality, we propose a Neural Template (NETE) explanation generation framework, which brings the best of both worlds by learning sentence templates from data and generating template-controlled sentences that comment about specific features. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that NETE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art explanation generation approaches in terms of sentence quality and expressiveness. Further analysis on case study also shows the advantages of NETE on generating diverse and controllable explanations."

In this paper, a demographic recommender system is utilized for the recommendation of attractions. This system categorizes the tourists using their demographic information and then makes recommendations based on demographic classes. Its advantage is that the history of ratings and extra knowledge are not needed, so a new tourist can obtain recommendation. Focusing on the attractions on Trip Advisor, we use different machine learning methods to produce prediction of ratings, so as to determine whether these approaches and demographic information of tourists are suitable for providing recommendations. Our preliminary results show that the methods and demographic information can be used to predict tourists' ratings on attractions. But using demographic information alone can only achieve limited accuracy. More information such as textual reviews is required to improve the accuracy of the recommendation."

Recommender systems have been developed to help users to find what they may be interested in and business owners to sell their products more efficiently. They have found much attention in both academia and industry. A recommender algorithm takes into account user\u2013item interactions, i.e., rating (or purchase) history of users on items, and their contextual information, if available. It then provides a list of potential items for each target user, such that the user is likely to positively rate (or purchase) them. In this paper, we review evaluation metrics used to assess performance of recommendation algorithms. We also survey a number of classical and modern recommendation algorithms and compare their performance in terms of different evaluation metrics on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that there is no golden recommendation algorithm showing the best performance in all evaluation metrics. We also find large variability across the datasets. This indicates that one should carefully consider the evaluation criteria in choosing a recommendation algorithm for a particular application."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, scholar recommender systems often recommend academic papers based on users\u2019 personalized retrieval demands. Typically, a recommender system analyzes the keywords typed by a user and then returns his or her preferred papers, in an efficient and economic manner. In practice, one paper often contains partial keywords that a user is interested in. Therefore, the recommender system needs to return the user a set of papers that collectively covers all the queried keywords. However, existing recommender systems only use the exact keyword matching technique for recommendation decisions, while neglecting the correlation relationships among different papers. As a consequence, it may output a set of papers from multiple disciplines that are different from the user\u2019s real research field. In view of this shortcoming, we propose a keyword-driven and popularity-aware paper recommendation approach based on an undirected paper citation graph, named PR keyword+pop . At last, we conduct large-scale experiments on the real-life Hep-Th dataset to further demonstrate the usefulness and feasibility of PR keyword+pop . Experimental results prove the advantages of PR keyword+pop in searching for a set of satisfactory papers compared with other competitive approaches."

Although effective, the utilization of the explicit user-user relationships extracted directly from such social information has three main limitations. First, it is difficult to obtain explicit and reliable social links. Only a small portion of users indicate explicitly their trusted friends in recommender systems. Second, the \u201ccold-start\u201d users are \u201ccold\u201d not only on rating but also on socializing. There is no significant amount of explicit social information that can be useful for \u201ccold-start\u201d users. Third, an active user can be socially connected with others who have different taste/preference. Direct usage of explicit social links may mislead recommendation. To address these issues, we propose to extract implicit and reliable social information from user feedbacks and identify top-k semantic friends for each user. We incorporate the top-k semantic friends information into MF and BPR frameworks to solve the problems of ratings prediction and items ranking, respectively. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed approaches achieve better results than the state-of-the-art MF with explicit social links (with 3.0% improvement on RMSE), and social BPR (with 9.1% improvement on AUC).MSC codesSocial Recommender SystemsNetwork EmbeddingTop-k Semantic FriendsMatrix FactorizationBayesian Personalized Ranking"

We show on eight datasets that our techniques improve the predictive power of recommender systems. Experiments with both explicit rating feedback and positive-only feedback confirm our findings showing that forgetting information is beneficial despite the extreme data sparsity that recommender systems struggle with. Improvement through forgetting also proves that users' preferences are subject to concept drift."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are embracing conversational technologies to obtain user preferences dynamically, and to overcome inherent limitations of their static models. A successful Conversational Recommender System (CRS) requires proper handling of interactions between conversation and recommendation. We argue that three fundamental problems need to be solved: 1) what questions to ask regarding item attributes, 2) when to recommend items, and 3) how to adapt to the users' online feedback. To the best of our knowledge, there lacks a unified framework that addresses these problems. In this work, we fill this missing interaction framework gap by proposing a new CRS framework named Estimation\"Action\" Reflection, or EAR, which consists of three stages to better converse with users. (1) Estimation, which builds predictive models to estimate user preference on both items and item attributes; (2) Action, which learns a dialogue policy to determine whether to ask attributes or recommend items, based on Estimation stage and conversation history; and (3) Reflection, which updates the recommender model when a user rejects the recommendations made by the Action stage. We present two conversation scenarios on binary and enumerated questions, and conduct extensive experiments on two datasets from Yelp and LastFM, for each scenario, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method CRM [32], corresponding to fewer conversation turns and a higher level of recommendation hits."

Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example, help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article, we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future."

Social relations provide an independent source for recommendation, bringing about new opportunities for recommender systems. Exploiting social relations to improve recommendation performance attracts a great amount of attention in recent years. Most existing social recommender systems treat social relations homogeneously and make use of direct connections (or strong dependency connections). However, connections in online social networks are intrinsically heterogeneous and are a composite of various relations. While connected users in online social networks form groups, and users in a group share similar interests, weak dependency connections are established among these users when they are not directly connected. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the heterogeneity of social relations and weak dependency connections for recommendation. In particular, we employ social dimensions to simultaneously capture heterogeneity of social relations and weak dependency connections, and provide principled ways to model social dimensions, and propose a recommendation framework SoDimRec which incorporates heterogeneity of social relations and weak dependency connections based on social dimensions. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We conduct further experiments to understand the important role of social dimensions in the proposed framework."

Here, we introduce an adversarial framework to enforce fairness constraints on graph embeddings. Our approach is compositional---meaning that it can flexibly accommodate different combinations of fairness constraints during inference. For instance, in the context of social recommendations, our framework would allow one user to request that their recommendations are invariant to both their age and gender, while also allowing another user to request invariance to just their age. Experiments on standard knowledge graph and recommender system benchmarks highlight the utility of our proposed framework."

In this article, we consider the knowledge graph (KG) as the source of side information. To address the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based methods for KG-aware recommendation, we propose RippleNet , an end-to-end framework that naturally incorporates the KG into recommender systems. RippleNet has two versions: (1) The outward propagation version, which is analogous to the actual ripples on water, stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user\u2019s potential interests along links in the KG. The multiple \u201cripples\u201d activated by a user\u2019s historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item. (2) The inward aggregation version aggregates and incorporates the neighborhood information biasedly when computing the representation of a given entity. The neighborhood can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity and capture users\u2019 long-distance interests. In addition, we intuitively demonstrate how a KG assists with recommender systems in RippleNet, and we also find that RippleNet provides a new perspective of explainability for the recommended results in terms of the KG. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that both versions of RippleNet achieve substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book, and news recommendations, over several state-of-the-art baselines."

For such offline evaluations, we are interested in methods that can compute offline an estimate of the potential uplift of performance generated by a new technology. Offline performance can be measured using estimators known as counterfactual or off-policy estimators. Traditional counterfactual estimators, such as capped importance sampling or normalised importance sampling, exhibit unsatisfying bias-variance compromises when experimenting on personalized product recommendation systems. To overcome this issue, we model the bias incurred by these estimators rather than bound it in the worst case, which leads us to propose a new counterfactual estimator. We provide a benchmark of the different estimators showing their correlation with business metrics observed by running online A/B tests on a large-scale commercial recommender system."

    "abstract": "Predicting a user's preference in a short anonymous interaction session instead of long-term history is a challenging problem in the real-life session-based recommendation, e.g., e-commerce and media stream. Recent research of the session-based recommender system mainly focuses on sequential patterns by utilizing the attention mechanism, which is straightforward for the session's natural sequence sorted by time. However, the user's preference is much more complicated than a solely consecutive time pattern in the transition of item choices. In this paper, therefore, we study the item transition pattern by constructing a session graph and propose a novel model which collaboratively considers the sequence order and the latent order in the session graph for a session-based recommender system. We formulate the next item recommendation within the session as a graph classification problem. Specifically, we propose a weighted attention graph layer and a Readout function to learn embeddings of items and sessions for the next item recommendation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmark E-commerce datasets, Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."

    "title": "A collaborative approach for research paper recommender system",
    "abstract": "Research paper recommenders emerged over the last decade to ease finding publications relating to researchers' area of interest. The challenge was not just to provide researchers with very rich publications at any time, any place and in any form but to also offer the right publication to the right researcher in the right way. Several approaches exist in handling paper recommender systems. However, these approaches assumed the availability of the whole contents of the recommending papers to be freely accessible, which is not always true due to factors such as copyright restrictions. This paper presents a collaborative approach for research paper recommender system. By leveraging the advantages of collaborative filtering approach, we utilize the publicly available contextual metadata to infer the hidden associations that exist between research papers in order to personalize recommendations. The novelty of our proposed approach is that it provides personalized recommendations regardless of the research field and regardless of the user's expertise. Using a publicly available dataset, our proposed approach has recorded a significant improvement over other baseline methods in measuring both the overall performance and the ability to return relevant and useful publications at the top of the recommendation list."

    "title": "Explore, exploit, and explain",
    "abstract": "The multi-armed bandit is an important framework for balancing exploration with exploitation in recommendation. Exploitation recommends content (e.g., products, movies, music playlists) with the highest predicted user engagement and has traditionally been the focus of recommender systems. Exploration recommends content with uncertain predicted user engagement for the purpose of gathering more information. The importance of exploration has been recognized in recent years, particularly in settings with new users, new items, non-stationary preferences and attributes. In parallel, explaining recommendations (\"recsplanations\") is crucial if users are to understand their recommendations. Existing work has looked at bandits and explanations independently. We provide the first method that combines both in a principled manner. In particular, our method is able to jointly (1) learn which explanations each user responds to; (2) learn the best content to recommend for each user; and (3) balance exploration with exploitation to deal with uncertainty. Experiments with historical log data and tests with live production traffic in a large-scale music recommendation service show a significant improvement in user engagement."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is a new-age thriving technology, which facilitates computers to read and interpret from the previously present data automatically. It makes use of multiple algorithms to build models, mathematical in nature, and then makes predictions for the new data using the past data and knowledge. Lately, it has been adopted for text detection, hate speech detection, recommender system, face detection, and more. In this paper, majorly all the aspects concerning five machine learning algorithms namely-K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) , and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network have been discussed in great detail which is a prerequisite for venturing into the field of ML. This paper throws light on various new results and conclusions related to these algorithms via research and review of recently published papers that carried out quantitative and qualitative research on real-time problems, mainly predictive analytics in multidisciplinary fields. This paper also talks about the circumstantial origin of these algorithms, which although has been rarely talked about in previous publications, is a preeminent point of discussion for ML enthusiasts and amateurs, both. To explain and understand the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the algorithms, they were exhaustively reviewed and researched in all aspects qualitatively and quantitatively, wherein the LSTM network and SVM algorithm have projected a superior behavior over the rest. The paper answers all relevant questions that may arise during the study of these algorithms ranging from their origin, to their definition, methodologies of execution, real-time applications attached with sufficient novel evidence, followed by the advantages and major trade-offs; lastly an elaborate comparison of their performances on quantitative and qualitative grounds has been presented. To conclude, the paper also highlights the future scope of ML algorithms and artificial intelligence in the coming times and their roles in automation and holistic development, not just in technology-related aspects but also, the humanitarian aspects, finally followed by reliable and relevant conclusions derived from this exhaustive research."

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system <xref idref=\"JR12942-1\">1</xref> <xref idref=\"JR12942-2\">2</xref> was adopted to define the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. <b>Main recommendations</b> <b>1 </b>ESGE recommends endoscopic en bloc resection for superficial esophageal squamous cell cancers (SCCs), excluding those with obvious submucosal involvement (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) may be considered in such lesions when they are smaller than 10 mm if en bloc resection can be assured. However, ESGE recommends endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) as the first option, mainly to provide an en bloc resection with accurate pathology staging and to avoid missing important histological features (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). <b>2 </b>ESGE recommends endoscopic resection with a curative intent for visible lesions in Barrett\u2019s esophagus (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). ESD has not been shown to be superior to EMR for excision of mucosal cancer, and for that reason EMR should be preferred. ESD may be considered in selected cases, such as lesions larger than 15 mm, poorly lifting tumors, and lesions at risk for submucosal invasion (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). <b>3 </b>ESGE recommends endoscopic resection for the treatment of gastric superficial neoplastic lesions that possess a very low risk of lymph node metastasis (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). EMR is an acceptable option for lesions smaller than 10 \u2013 15 mm with a very low probability of advanced histology (Paris 0-IIa). However, ESGE recommends ESD as treatment of choice for most gastric superficial neoplastic lesions (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). <b>4 </b>ESGE states that the majority of colonic and rectal superficial lesions can be effectively removed in a curative way by standard polypectomy and/or by EMR (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). ESD can be considered for removal of colonic and rectal lesions with high suspicion of limited submucosal invasion that is based on two main criteria of depressed morphology and irregular or nongranular surface pattern, particularly if the lesions are larger than 20 mm; or ESD can be considered for colorectal lesions that otherwise cannot be optimally and radically removed by snare-based techniques (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence)."

    "abstract": "Most recommender systems focus on the areas of leisure activities. As the Web evolves into omnipresent utility, recommender systems penetrate more serious applications such as those in online scientific communities. In this paper, we investigate the task of recommendation in online scientific communities which exhibit two characteristics: 1) there exists very rich information about users and items; 2) The users in the scientific communities tend not to give explicit ratings to the resources, even though they have clear preference in their minds. To address the above two characteristics, we propose matrix factorization techniques to incorporate rich user and item information into recommendation with implicit feedback. Specifically, the user information matrix is decomposed into a shared subspace with the implicit feedback matrix, and so does the item information matrix. In other words, the subspaces between multiple related matrices are jointly learned by sharing information between the matrices. The experiments on the testbed from an online scientific community (i.e., Nanohub) show that the proposed method can effectively improve the recommendation performance."

It tries to address the problem of why: by providing explanations to users or system designers, it helps humans to understand why certain items are recommended by the algorithm, where the human can either be users or system designers. Explainable recommendation helps to improve the transparency, persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of recommendation systems, and facilitates system designers for better system debugging. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches have been proposed and applied in real-world systems. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the explainable recommendation research. The authors first highlight the position of explainable recommendation in recommender system research by categorizing recommendation problems into the 5W (what, when, who, where, and why). They then conduct a comprehensive survey of explainable recommendation on three perspectives: (1) a chronological research timeline of explainable recommendation; (2) a two-dimensional taxonomy to classify existing explainable recommendation research; (3) a summary of how explainable recommendation applies to different recommendation tasks. The authors also devote a section to discuss the explanation perspectives in broader IR and AI/ML research and end the survey by discussing potential future directions to promote the explainable recommendation research area and beyond."

These systems provide personalized services to assist users in finding favorite items among the huge number of available media on the World Wide Web. Identifying temporal preferences of individuals is one of the major challenges of recommender systems to provide personalization for users. In this paper, a content-based movie recommender system is proposed that captures the temporal user preferences in user modeling and predicts the preferred movies. The proposed method provides a user-centered framework that incorporates the content attributes of rated movies (for each user) into a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model to infer user preferences and provide a proper recommendation list. We implement the proposed method and use the MovieLens dataset to perform experiments. The evaluation results show that the performance of proposed recommendation method outperforms the existing movie recommender systems."

    "title": "A Practical Privacy-Preserving Recommender System",
    "abstract": "The main goal of a personalized recommender system is to provide useful recommendations on various items to the users. In order to generate recommendations, the service needs to access various types of user data such as previous product purchasing history, demographic and biographical information. However, users are sensitive to disclosure of personal information as it can be easily misused by malicious third parties. Consequently, there are unavoidable security concerns which will become known through attempted unauthorized access while providing the recommendation services. In order to protect against breaches of personal information, it is necessary to obfuscate the user information by means of an efficient encryption technique while simultaneously generating the recommendation by making true information inaccessible to the system. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy-preserving recommender system using homomorphic encryption, by which the system can provide recommendations without knowing the actual ratings. Our approach is based on the ElGamal cryptosystem by which both addition and multiplication of plaintexts can be performed. The performance of the proposed scheme shows significantly high accuracy in-terms of computation and communication costs as well as outperforming other existing solutions."

The ultimate purpose of the system is to give the customers personalized recommendations based on their preference. Similarly, the location and orientation will also play a crucial role in identifying the preference of the customer is a more efficient manner. Almost all social networks make use of location information to provide better services to the users based on the research performed. Hence there is a need for developing a recommender system that is dependent on location. In this paper, we have incorporated a recommender system that makes use of recommender algorithm that is personalized to take into consideration the context of the user. The preference of the user is analysed with the help of IoT smart devices like the smart watches, Google home, smart phones, ipads etc. The user preferences are obtained from these devices and will enable the recommender system to gauge the best resources. The results based on evaluation are compared with that of the content-based recommender algorithm and collaborative filtering to enable the recommendation engine\u2019s power."

This makes explicitly combating selection biases an essential problem in training recommender systems. Most previous studies assume no unbiased data available for training. We relax this assumption and assume that a small subset of training data is unbiased. Then, we propose a novel objective that utilizes the unbiased data to adaptively assign propensity weights to biased training ratings. This objective, combined with unbiased performance estimators, alleviates the effects of selection biases on the training of recommender systems. To optimize the objective, we propose an efficient algorithm that minimizes the variance of propensity estimates for better generalized recommender systems. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm the advantages of our approach in significantly reducing both the error of rating prediction and the variance of propensity estimation."

Second, we introduce two NB methods: one is based on correlation coefficients and the other on linear least squares. At the experimentation part, we show that the proposed approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time.

Recent studies show that incorporating the hierarchy of items or user preferences can improve the performance of recommender systems. However, hierarchical structures are often not explicitly available, especially those of user preferences. Thus, there's a gap between the importance of hierarchies and their availability. In this paper, we investigate the problem of exploring the implicit hierarchical structures for recommender systems when they are not explicitly available. We propose a novel recommendation framework to bridge the gap, which enables us to explore the implicit hierarchies of users and items simultaneously. We then extend the framework to integrate explicit hierarchies when they are available, which gives a unified framework for both explicit and implicit hierarchical structures. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by incorporating implicit and explicit structures."

The list of histological variants has also been expanded. In line with recent morphological and molecular data on glioma progression, the glioblastoma is now grouped together with astrocytic tumours. The classification of childhood tumours has been largely retained, the diagnosis primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET) only being recommended as a generic term for cerebellar meduiloblastomas and neoplasms that are histologically indistinguishable from medulloblastoma but located in the CNS at sites other than the cerebellum. The WHO grading scheme was revised and adapted to new entities but its use, as before, remains optional."

However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, a few malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in recent work [5, 7]. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of spam profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work, we provide a simple unsupervised algorithm, which exploits statistical properties of effective spam profiles to provide a highly accurate and fast algorithm for detecting spam."

Recommendations can be used to overcome current limitations of learning management systems in providing personalization and accessibility features. Recommenders can take advantage of standards-based solutions to provide inclusive support. To this end we have identified the need for developing semantic educational recommender systems, which are able to extend existing learning management systems with adaptive navigation support. In this paper we present three requirements to be considered in developing these semantic educational recommender systems, which are in line with the service-oriented approach of the third generation of learning management systems, namely: (i) a recommendation model; (ii) an open standards-based service-oriented architecture; and (iii) a usable and accessible graphical user interface to deliver the recommendations."

In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy. First, pursue clinical clues to potential hypoglycemic etiologies--drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, nonislet cell tumors. In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction--addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations--in persons with diabetes."

This paper introduces SPLATT, a C library with shared-memory parallelism for three-mode tensors. SPLATT contains algorithmic improvements over competing state of the art tools for sparse tensor factorization. SPLATT has a fast, parallel method of multiplying a matricide tensor by a Khatri-Rao product, which is a key kernel in tensor factorization methods. SPLATT uses a novel data structure that exploits the sparsity patterns of tensors. This data structure has a small memory footprint similar to competing methods and allows for the computational improvements featured in our work. We also present a method of finding cache-friendly reordering and utilizing them with a novel form of cache tiling. To our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate reordering and cache tiling in this context. SPLATT averages almost 30x speedup compared to our baseline when using 16 threads and reaches over 80x speedup on NELL-2."

Such a problem can be tackled, allowing the recovery of the missing values, if the matrix should be of low rank (when noise free). The filling in of missing values is known as imputation. Imputation can also be applied in the various subspace techniques for face and shape classification, online \"recommender\" systems, and a wide variety of other applications. However, iterative imputation can lead to the \"recovery\" of data that is seriously in error. In this paper, we provide a method to recover the most reliable imputation, in terms of deciding when the inclusion of extra rows or columns, containing significant numbers of missing entries, is likely to lead to poor recovery of the missing parts. Although the proposed approach can be equally applied to a wide range of imputation methods, this paper addresses only the SFM problem. The performance of the proposed method is compared with Jacobs' and Shum's methods for SFM."

A desirable fairness property in microlending is to give borrowers from different demographic groups a fair chance of being recommended, as stated by Kiva. To achieve this goal, we propose a Fairness-Aware Re-ranking (FAR) algorithm to balance ranking quality and borrower-side fairness. Furthermore, we take into consideration that lenders may differ in their receptivity to the diversification of recommended loans, and develop a Personalized Fairness-Aware Re-ranking (PFAR) algorithm. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Kiva.org show that our re-ranking algorithm can significantly promote fairness with little sacrifice in accuracy, and be attentive to individual lender preference on loan diversity."

In this paper, to overcome the aforementioned drawback, we first formulate the relationships between users and items as a bipartite graph. Then, we propose a new spectral convolution operation directly performing in the \\textit{spectral domain}, where not only the proximity information of a graph but also the connectivity information hidden in the graph are revealed. With the proposed spectral convolution operation, we build a deep recommendation model called Spectral Collaborative Filtering (SpectralCF). Benefiting from the rich information of connectivity existing in the \\textit{spectral domain}, SpectralCF is capable of discovering deep connections between users and items and therefore, alleviates the \\textit{cold-start} problem for CF. To the best of our knowledge, SpectralCF is the first CF-based method directly learning from the \\textit{spectral domains} of user-item bipartite graphs. We apply our method on several standard datasets. It is shown that SpectralCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

In this paper, we propose AddGraph, a general end-to-end anomalous edge detection framework using an extended temporal GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) with an attention model, which can capture both long-term patterns and the short-term patterns in dynamic graphs. In order to cope with insufficient explicit labelled data, we employ the negative sampling and margin loss in training of AddGraph in a semi-supervised fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and illustrate that AddGraph can outperform the state-of-the-art competitors in anomaly detection significantly."

A standard k-nearest neighbor recommender is used as a baseline in both evaluation settings. Our evaluation shows that even though the proposed furthest neighbor model is outperformed in the traditional evaluation setting, the perceived usefulness of the algorithm shows no significant difference in the results of the user study."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hybrid music recommender system that ranks musical pieces while efficiently maintaining collaborative and content-based data, i.e., rating scores given by users and acoustic features of audio signals. This hybrid approach overcomes the conventional tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and variety of recommended artists. Collaborative filtering, which is used on e-commerce sites, cannot recommend nonbrated pieces and provides a narrow variety of artists. Content-based filtering does not have satisfactory accuracy because it is based on the heuristics that the user's favorite pieces will have similar musical content despite there being exceptions. To attain a higher recommendation accuracy along with a wider variety of artists, we use a probabilistic generative model that unifies the collaborative and content-based data in a principled way. This model can explain the generative mechanism of the observed data in the probability theory. The probability distribution over users, pieces, and features is decomposed into three conditionally independent ones by introducing latent variables. This decomposition enables us to efficiently and incrementally adapt the model for increasing numbers of users and rating scores. We evaluated our system by using audio signals of commercial CDs and their corresponding rating scores obtained from an e-commerce site. The results revealed that our system accurately recommended pieces including nonrated ones from a wide variety of artists and maintained a high degree of accuracy even when new users and rating scores were added."

    "title": "An improved collaborative filtering method based on similarity",
    "abstract": "The recommender system is widely used in the field of e-commerce and plays an important role in guiding customers to make smart decisions. Although many algorithms are available in the recommender system, collaborative filtering is still one of the most used and successful recommendation technologies. In collaborative filtering, similarity calculation is the main issue. In order to improve the accuracy and quality of recommendations, we proposed an improved similarity model, which takes three impact factors of similarity into account to minimize the deviation of similarity calculation. Compared with the traditional similarity measure, the advantages of our proposed model are that it makes full use of rating data and solves the problem of co-rated items. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, experiments were performed on four datasets. Results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the preferences of the recommender system and it is suitable for the sparsity data."

    "abstract": "Third party apps are an integral component of the smartphone ecosystem. In this paper, we investigate how user traits can be inferred by observing only a single snapshot of installed apps. Using supervised learning methods and minimal external information we show that user traits such as religion, relationship status, spoken languages, countries of interest, and whether or not the user is a parent of small children, can be easily predicted. Using data collected from over 200 smartphone users, specifically the list of installed apps and the corresponding ground truth traits of the users, we show that for most traits we can achieve over 90% precision. Our inference method can be used to provide services such as personalized content delivery or recommender systems for users. We also highlight privacy loss that can occur from unrestricted access to the app lists in popular smartphone operating systems."

    "title": "Detecting noise in recommender system databases",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework that enables the detection of noise in recommender system databases. We consider two classes of noise: natural and malicious noise. The issue of natural noise arises from imperfect user behaviour (e.g. erroneous/careless preference selection) and the various rating collection processes that are employed. Malicious noise concerns the deliberate attempt to bias system output in some particular manner. We argue that both classes of noise are important and can adversely effect recommendation performance. Our objective is to devise techniques that enable system administrators to identify and remove from the recommendation process any such noise that is present in the data. We provide an empirical evaluation of our approach and demonstrate that it is successful with respect to key performance indicators."

    "title": "PeerChooser",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) has been successfully deployed over the years to compute predictions on items based on a user's correlation with a set of peers. The black-box nature of most CF applications leave the user wondering how the system arrived at its recommendation. This note introduces PeerChooser, a collaborative recommender system with an interactive graphical explanation interface. Users are provided with a visual explanation of the CF process and opportunity to manipulate their neighborhood at varying levels of granularity to reflect aspects of their current requirements. In this manner we overcome the problem of redundant profile information in CF systems, in addition to providing an explanation interface. Our layout algorithm produces an exact, noiseless graph representation of the underlying correlations between users. PeerChooser's prediction component uses this graph directly to yield the same results as the benchmark. User's then improve on these predictions by tweaking the graph to their current requirements. We present a user-survey in which PeerChooser compares favorably against a benchmark CF algorithm."

    "title": "A Deep Graph Neural Network-Based Mechanism for Social Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, the issue of information overload is gradually gaining exposure in the Internet of Things (IoT), calling for more research on recommender system in advance for industrial IoT scenarios. With the ever-increasing prevalence of various social networks, social recommendations (SoR) will certainly become an integral application that provides more feasibly personalized information service for future IoT users. However, almost all of the existing research managed to explore and quantify correlations between user preferences and social relationships, while neglecting the correlations among item features which could further influence the topologies of some social groups. To tackle with this challenge, in this article, a deep graph neural network-based social recommendation framework (GNN-SoR) is proposed for future IoTs. First, user and item feature spaces are abstracted as two graph networks and respectively encoded via the graph neural network method. Next, two encoded spaces are embedded into two latent factors of matrix factorization to complete missing rating values in a user-item rating matrix. Finally, a large amount of experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets to verify the efficiency and stability of the proposed GNN-SoR."

    "title": "Enhancing Social Recommendation With Adversarial Graph Convolutional Networks",
    "abstract": "Social recommender systems are expected to improve recommendation quality by incorporating social information when there is little user-item interaction data. However, recent reports from industry show that social recommender systems consistently fail in practice. According to the negative findings, the failure is attributed to: (1) A majority of users only have a very limited number of neighbors in social networks and can hardly benefit from social relations; (2) Social relations are noisy but they are indiscriminately used; (3) Social relations are assumed to be universally applicable to multiple scenarios while they are actually multi-faceted and show heterogeneous strengths in different scenarios. Most existing social recommendation models only consider the homophily in social networks and neglect these drawbacks. In this paper we propose a deep adversarial framework based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) to address these problems. Concretely, for (1) and (2), a GCN-based autoencoder is developed to augment the relation data by encoding high-order and complex connectivity patterns, and meanwhile is optimized subject to the constraint of reconstructing the social profile to guarantee the validity of the identified neighborhood. After obtaining enough purified social relations for each user, a GCN-based attentive social recommendation module is designed to address (3) by capturing the heterogeneous strengths of social relations. Finally, we adopt adversarial training to unify all the components by playing a Minimax game and ensure a coordinated effort to enhance recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on multiple open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework and the ablation study confirms the importance and effectiveness of each component."

The 2011 STRAW + 10 reviewed advances in understanding of the critical changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function that occur before and after the final menstrual period. Scientists from five countries and multiple disciplines evaluated data from cohort studies of midlife women and in the context of chronic illness and endocrine disorders on change in menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers of reproductive aging including antim\u00fcllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count. Modifications were adopted by consensus. STRAW + 10 simplified bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage -3) and the early postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transition (Stage -1) and early postmenopause (Stage +1), and recommended application regardless of women's age, ethnicity, body size, or lifestyle characteristics. STRAW + 10 provides a more comprehensive basis for assessing reproductive aging in research and clinical contexts. Application of the STRAW + 10 staging system should improve comparability of studies of midlife women and facilitate clinical decision making.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to develop evidence\u2010based clinical practice guidelines for nutrition support (ie, enteral and parenteral nutrition) in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults. OPTIONS: The following interventions were systematically reviewed for inclusion in the guidelines: enteral nutrition (EN) versus parenteral nutrition (PN), early versus late EN, dose of EN, composition of EN (protein, carbohydrates, lipids, immune\u2010enhancing additives), strategies to optimize delivery of EN and minimize risks (ie, rate of advancement, checking residuals, use of bedside algorithms, motility agents, small bowel versus gastric feedings, elevation of the head of the bed, closed delivery systems, probiotics, bolus administration), enteral nutrition in combination with supplemental PN, use of PN versus standard care in patients with an intact gastrointestinal tract, dose of PN and composition of PN (protein, carbohydrates, IV lipids, additives, vitamins, trace elements, immune enhancing substances), and the use of intensive insulin therapy. OUTCOMES: The outcomes considered were mortality (intensive care unit [ICU], hospital, and long\u2010term), length of stay (ICU and hospital), quality of life, and specific complications. EVIDENCE: We systematically searched MEDLINE and CINAHL (cumulative index to nursing and allied health), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials and meta\u2010analyses of randomized controlled trials that evaluated any form of nutrition support in critically ill adults. We also searched reference lists and personal files, considering all articles published or unpublished available by August 2002. Each included study was critically appraised in duplicate using a standard scoring system. VALUES: For each intervention, we considered the validity of the randomized trials or meta\u2010analyses, the effect size and its associated confidence intervals, the homogeneity of trial results, safety, feasibility, and the economic consequences. The context for discussion was mechanically ventilated patients in Canadian ICUs. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: The major potential benefit from implementing these guidelines is improved clinical outcomes of critically ill patients (reduced mortality and ICU stay). Potential harms of implementing these guidelines include increased complications and costs related to the suggested interventions. SUMMARIES OF EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS: When considering nutrition support in critically ill patients, we strongly recommend that EN be used in preference to PN. We recommend the use of a standard, polymeric enteral formula that is initiated within 24 to 48 hours after admission to ICU, that patients be cared for in the semirecumbent position, and that arginine\u2010containing enteral products not be used. Strategies to optimize delivery of EN (starting at the target rate, use of a feeding protocol using a higher threshold of gastric residuals volumes, use of motility agents, and use of small bowel feeding) and minimize the risks of EN (elevation of the head of the bed) should be considered. Use of products with fish oils, borage oils, and antioxidants should be considered for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. A glutamine\u2010enriched formula should be considered for patients with severe burns and trauma. When initiating EN, we strongly recommend that PN not be used in combination with EN. When PN is used, we recommend that it be supplemented with glutamine, where available. Strategies that maximize the benefit and minimize the risks of PN (hypocaloric dose, withholding lipids, and the use of intensive insulin therapy to achieve tight glycemic control) should be considered. There are insufficient data to generate recommendations in the following areas: use of indirect calorimetry; optimal pH of EN; supplementation with trace elements, antioxidants, or fiber; optimal mix of fats and carbohydrates; use of closed feeding systems; continuous versus bolus feedings; use of probiotics; type of lipids; and mode of lipid delivery. VALIDATION: This guideline was peer\u2010reviewed and endorsed by official representatives of the Canadian Critical Care Society, Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, Dietitians of Canada, Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses, and the Canadian Society for Clinical Nutrition. SPONSORS: This guideline is a joint venture of the Canadian Critical Care Society, the Canadian Critical Trials Group, the Canadian Society for Clinical Nutrition, and Dietitians of Canada. The Canadian Critical Care Society and the Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism, and Diabetes of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research provided funding for development of this guideline."

    "title": "Effects of Invasive Alien Plants on Fire Regimes",
    "abstract": "Plant invasions are widely recognized as significant threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. One way invasions can affect native ecosystems is by changing fuel properties, which can in turn affect fire behavior and, ultimately, alter fire regime characteristics such as frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality of fire. If the regime changes subsequently promote the dominance of the invaders, then an invasive plant\u2013fire regime cycle can be established. As more ecosystem components and interactions are altered, restoration of preinvasion conditions becomes more difficult. Restoration may require managing fuel conditions, fire regimes, native plant communities, and other ecosystem properties in addition to the invaders that caused the changes in the first place. We present a multiphase model describing the interrelationships between plant invaders and fire regimes, provide a system for evaluating the relative effects of invaders and prioritizing them for control, and recommend ways to restore pre-invasion fire regime properties."

We then compare a typical traditional CF-approach to a social recommender / social filtering approach where friends from the underlying social network are used as rating neighborhood and analyze the experiments statistically. Surprisingly, the social filtering approach outperforms the CF approach in all variants of the experiment. The implications of the experiment for professional and private-life collaborative environments and services where recommendations play a role are discussed. We conclude with future perspectives on social recommender systems, especially in upcoming mobile environments."

This problem appears in applications such as recommender systems, social network analysis or citation analysis. Link prediction in time-evolving networks is usually based on the topological structure of the network only. We propose here a model which exploits multiple information sources in the network in order to predict link occurrence probabilities as a function of time. The model integrates three types of information: the global network structure, the content of nodes in the network if any, and the local or proximity information of a given vertex. The proposed model is based on a matrix factorization formulation of the problem with graph regularization. We derive an efficient optimization method to learn the latent factors of this model. Extensive experiments on several real world datasets suggest that our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for temporal link prediction tasks."

As the distances between people have been greatly shortened, there has been more general demand for the provision of personalized services aimed at groups instead of individuals. The existing methods for capturing group-level preference features from individuals have mostly been established via aggregation and face two challenges: 1) secure data management workflows are absent and 2) implicit preference feedback is ignored. To tackle these current difficulties, this article proposes secure AIoT for implicit group recommendations (SAIoT-GRs). For the hardware module, a secure Internet of Things structure is developed as the bottom support platform. For the software module, a collaborative Bayesian network model and noncooperative game are introduced as algorithms. This secure AIoT architecture is able to maximize the advantages of the two modules. In addition, a large number of experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of SAIoT-GR in terms of efficiency and robustness."

Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns.

Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts.

Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the proposed terminology"

    "abstract": "Many recommenders aim to provide relevant recommendations to users by building personal topic interest profiles and then using these profiles to find interesting contents for the user. In social media, recommender systems build user profiles by directly combining users' topic interest signals from a wide variety of consumption and publishing behaviors, such as social media posts they authored, commented on, +1'd or liked. Here we propose to separately model users' topical interests that come from these various behavioral signals in order to construct better user profiles. Intuitively, since publishing a post requires more effort, the topic interests coming from publishing signals should be more accurate of a user's central interest than, say, a simple gesture such as a +1. By separating a single user's interest profile into several behavioral profiles, we obtain better and cleaner topic interest signals, as well as enabling topic prediction for different types of behavior, such as topics that the user might +1 or comment on, but might never write a post on that topic."

We develop an approach to recommender systems that incorporates an explicit utility model into the recommendation process in a decision-theoretically sound fashion. The system maintains explicit constraints on user utility based on preferences revealed by the user's actions. We investigate a new decision criterion, setwise minimax regret (SMR), for constructing optimal recommendation sets: we develop algorithms for computing SMR, and prove that SMR determines choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal. This provides a natural basis for generating compound critiques in conversational recommender systems. Our simulation results suggest that this utility-theoretically sound approach to user modeling allows much more effective navigation of a product space than traditional approaches based on, for example, heuristic utility models and product similarity measures."

Decision making becomes even more difficult when a group, instead of an individual consumer, will consume the product, as is regularly the case for hedonic offerings such as movies, opera performances, and wine. Noting the prevalence of automated recommender systems as decision aids, the authors investigate the power of group recommender systems that consider the preferences of all group members. The authors develop a conceptual framework of the effects of group recommenders and empirically examine these effects through two choice experiments. They find that automated group recommenders offer more valuable information than single recommenders when the choice agent must consume the recommended alternative. However, when agents choose freely among alternatives, the group's social relationship quality determines whether group recommenders actually create higher group value. Finally, group recommenders outperform decision making without automated recommendations if the agent's intention to use the systems is high. A decision tree model of recommender usage offers guidance to hedonic product managers."

Models of this form have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts since they produce a set of rules that concisely describe a specific class. We present two probabilistic models with prior parameters that the user can set to encourage the model to have a desired size and shape, to conform with a domain-specific definition of interpretability. We provide a scalable MAP inference approach and develop theoretical bounds to reduce computation by iteratively pruning the search space.

To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by identifying other users with similar taste and use their opinions for recommendation; whereas content-based recommender systems recommend items based on the content information of the items. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialization, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hybrid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed a unique switching hybrid recommendation approach by combining a Naive Bayes classification approach with the collaborative filtering. Experimental results on two different data sets, show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and provide better performance \u2013 in terms of accuracy and coverage \u2013 than other algorithms while at the same time eliminates some recorded problems with the recommender systems."

However, User-Item rating matrix is not always available or very sparse in some web applications, which has critical impact to the application of CF recommenders. In this article we aim to enhance the online recommender system by fusing virtual ratings as derived from user reviews. Specifically, taking into account of Chinese reviews' characteristics, we propose to fuse the self-supervised emotion-integrated sentiment classification results into CF recommenders, by which the User-Item Rating Matrix can be inferred by decomposing item reviews that users gave to the items. The main advantage of this approach is that it can extend CF recommenders to some web applications without user rating information. In the experiments, we have first identified the self-supervised sentiment classification's higher precision and recall by comparing it with traditional classification methods. Furthermore, the classification results, as behaving as virtual ratings, were incorporated into both user-based and item-based CF algorithms. We have also conducted an experiment to evaluate the proximity between the virtual and real ratings and clarified the effectiveness of the virtual ratings. The experimental results demonstrated the significant impact of virtual ratings on increasing system's recommendation accuracy in different data conditions (i.e., conditions with real ratings and without)."

Although users have greater similarity with their allies than their friends and nemeses, surprisingly, the allies network does not affect voting behavior, despite being as large as the friends network. In contrast, users are influenced differently by their friends and nemeses, indicating that people use these networks for distinct purposes.

It is more realistic and practical to study recommender systems with inputs of streaming data. User-generated streaming data presents unique properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous new challenges for the once very successful recommendation techniques. Although a few temporal or sequential recommender models have recently been developed based on recurrent neural models, most of them can only be applied to the session-based recommendation scenario, due to their short-term memories and the limited capability of capturing users' long-term stable interests. In this paper, we propose a streaming recommender model based on neural memory networks with external memories to capture and store both long-term stable interests and short-term dynamic interests in a unified way. An adaptive negative sampling framework based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is developed to optimize our proposed streaming recommender model, which effectively overcomes the limitations of classical negative sampling approaches and improves both effectiveness and efficiency of the model parameter inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two large-scale recommendation datasets, and the experimental results show the superiority of our proposed streaming recommender model in the streaming recommendation scenario."

Traditional techniques become unqualified because they ignore social relation data; existing social recommendation approaches consider social network structure, but social contextual information has not been fully considered. It is significant and challenging to fuse social contextual factors which are derived from users' motivation of social behaviors into social recommendation. In this paper, we investigate the social recommendation problem on the basis of psychology and sociology studies, which exhibit two important factors: individual preference and interpersonal influence. We first present the particular importance of these two factors in online behavior prediction. Then we propose a novel probabilistic matrix factorization method to fuse them in latent space. We further provide a scalable algorithm which can incrementally process the large scale data. We conduct experiments on both Facebook style bidirectional and Twitter style unidirectional social network data sets.

In this paper, we argue that modeling pairwise relationships directly leads to an efficient representation of sequential features and captures complex item correlations. Specifically, we propose a 2D convolutional network for sequential recommendation (CosRec). It encodes a sequence of items into a three-way tensor; learns local features using 2D convolutional filters; and aggregates high-order interactions in a feedforward manner. Quantitative results on two public datasets show that our method outperforms both conventional methods and recent sequence-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various evaluation metrics."

Chun, who has a background in systems design engineering as well as media studies and cultural theory, explains that although machine learning algorithms may not officially include race as a category, they embed whiteness as a default. Facial recognition technology, for example, relies on the faces of Hollywood celebrities and university undergraduates\u2014groups not famous for their diversity. Homophily emerged as a concept to describe white U.S. resident attitudes to living in biracial yet segregated public housing. Predictive policing technology deploys models trained on studies of predominantly underserved neighborhoods. Trained on selected and often discriminatory or dirty data, these algorithms are only validated if they mirror this data. How can we release ourselves from the vice-like grip of discriminatory data? Chun calls for alternative algorithms, defaults, and interdisciplinary coalitions in order to desegregate networks and foster a more democratic big data."

    "title": "Capital disadvantage: America's failing capital investment system.",
    "abstract": "The U.S. system of allocating investment capital is failing, putting American companies at a serious disadvantage and threatening the long-term growth of the nation's economy. The problem, says Michael Porter, goes beyond the usual formulation of the issue: accusations of \"short-termism\" by U.S. managers, ineffective corporate governance by directors, or a high cost of capital. The problem involves the external capital allocation system by which capital is provided to companies, as well as the system by which companies allocate capital internally. America's system is marked by fluid capital and a financial focus. Other countries--notably Japan and Germany--have systems with dedicated capital and a focus on corporate position. In global competition, where investment increasingly determines a company's capacity to upgrade and innovate, the U.S. system does not measure up. These conclusions come out of a two-year research project sponsored by the Harvard Business School and the Council on Competitiveness. Porter recommends five far-reaching reforms to make the U.S. system superior to Japan's and Germany's: 1. Improve the present macroeconomic environment. 2. Expand true ownership throughout the system so that directors, managers, employees, and even customers and suppliers hold positions as owners. 3. Align the goals of capital providers, corporations, directors, managers, employees, customers, suppliers, and society. 4. Improve the information used in decision making. 5. Foster more productive modes of interaction and influence among capital providers, corporations, and business units."

    "abstract": "Personalized recommender systems have emerged as a powerful method for improving both the content of customers and the profit of providers in e-business environment. Nowadays, many kinds of recommender methods have been proposed to provide personalized services. However, all these techniques have not made full use of the semantic information of objects, which leading them to an unsatisfying performance. Collaborative filter (CF) system, as the most popular personalized recommender systems, has such well-known limitations as sparsity, scalability and cold-start problem. A semantic-enhanced collaborative recommender system is proposed in this paper. The semantic information of objects is extracted to support the recommendation process. This study compares the performance of the proposed technique with the traditional CF approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "title": "Aesthetic-based Clothing Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recently, product images have gained increasing attention in clothing recommendation since the visual appearance of clothing products has a significant impact on consumers' decision. Most existing methods rely on conventional features to represent an image, such as the visual features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNN features) and the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm (SIFT features), color histograms, and so on. Nevertheless, one important type of features, the \\emph{aesthetic features}, is seldom considered. It plays a vital role in clothing recommendation since a users' decision depends largely on whether the clothing is in line with her aesthetics, however the conventional image features cannot portray this directly. To bridge this gap, we propose to introduce the aesthetic information, which is highly relevant with user preference, into clothing recommender systems. To achieve this, we first present the aesthetic features extracted by a pre-trained neural network, which is a brain-inspired deep structure trained for the aesthetic assessment task. Considering that the aesthetic preference varies significantly from user to user and by time, we then propose a new tensor factorization model to incorporate the aesthetic features in a personalized manner. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate that our approach can capture the aesthetic preference of users and significantly outperform several state-of-the-art recommendation methods."

    "title": "3D Convolutional Networks for Session-based Recommendation with Content Features",
    "abstract": "In many real-life recommendation settings, user profiles and past activities are not available. The recommender system should make predictions based on session data, e.g. session clicks and descriptions of clicked items. Conventional recommendation approaches, which rely on past user-item interaction data, cannot deliver accurate results in these situations. In this paper, we describe a method that combines session clicks and content features such as item descriptions and item categories to generate recommendations. To model these data, which are usually of different types and nature, we use 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks with character-level encoding of all input data. While 3D architectures provide a natural way to capture spatio-temporal patterns, character-level networks allow modeling different data types using their raw textual representation, thus reducing feature engineering effort. We applied the proposed method to predict add-to-cart events in e-commerce websites, which is more difficult then predicting next clicks. On two real datasets, our method outperformed several baselines and a state-of-the-art method based on recurrent neural networks."

    "title": "The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley",
    "abstract": "Author(s): Asanovic, K; Bodik, R; Catanzaro, B; Gebis, J; Husbands, P; Keutzer, K; Patterson, D; Plishker, W; Shalf, J; Williams, SW | Abstract: The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation. A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level parallelism. We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following: \u2022 The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems \u2022 The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon, and MIPS per development dollar. \u2022 Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 \u201cDwarfs\u201d to design and evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and communication.) \u2022 \u201cAutotuners\u201d should play a larger role than conventional compilers in translating parallel programs. \u2022 To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware or applications. \u2022 To be successful, programming models should be independent of the number of processors. \u2022 To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism: task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism. 1 The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View From Berkeley \u2022 Architects should not include features that significantly affect performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their impact via performance counters and energy counters. \u2022 Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual machines. \u2022 To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable and low cost. Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel. Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of highly parallel systems."

    "title": "PoisonRec: An Adaptive Data Poisoning Framework for Attacking Black-box Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Data-driven recommender systems that can help to predict users' preferences are deployed in many real online service platforms. Several studies show that they are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and attackers have the ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. Considering the realistic scenario, where the recommender system is usually a black-box for attackers and complex algorithms may be deployed in them, how to learn effective attack strategies on such recommender systems is still an under-explored problem. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data poisoning framework, PoisonRec, which can automatically learn effective attack strategies on various recommender systems with very limited knowledge. PoisonRec leverages the reinforcement learning architecture, in which an attack agent actively injects fake data (user behaviors) into the recommender system, and then can improve its attack strategies through reward signals that are available under the strict black-box setting. Specifically, we model the attack behavior trajectory as the Markov Decision Process (MDP) in reinforcement learning. We also design a Biased Complete Binary Tree (BCBT) to reformulate the action space for better attack performance. We adopt 8 widely-used representative recommendation algorithms as our testbeds, and make extensive experiments on 4 different real-world datasets. The results show that PoisonRec has the ability to achieve good attack performance on various recommender systems with limited knowledge."

It plays a crucial role in today's business and users' experience. Also, e-commerce platforms produce a vast amount of information. So, Recommender Systems (RSs) are a solution to overcome the information overload problem. They provide personalized recommendations to improve user satisfaction. The present article illustrates a comprehensive and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding the papers published in the field of e-commerce recommender systems. We reviewed the selected papers to identify the gaps and significant issues of the RSs' traditional methods, which guide the researchers to do future work. So, we provided the traditional techniques, challenges, and open issues concerning traditional methods of the field of review based on the selected papers. This review includes five categories of the RSs' algorithms, including Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), Demographic-Based Filtering (DBF), hybrid filtering, and Knowledge-Based Filtering (KBF). Also, the salient points of each selected paper are briefly reported. The publication time of the selected papers ranged from 2008 to 2019. Also, we provided a comparison table of important issues of the selected papers as well as the tables of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we provided a comparative table of metrics and review issues for the selected papers. And finally, the conclusions can, to a great extent, provide valuable guidelines for future studies."

    "title": "Social ranking",
    "abstract": "Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy."

    "abstract": "The increasing growth of e-commerce industry in Indonesia motivates e-commerce sites to provide better services to its customer. One of the strategies to improves e-commerce services is by providing personal recommendation, which can be done using recommender systems. However, there is still lack of studies exploring the best technique to implement recommender systems for e-commerce in Indonesia. This study compares the performance of two implementation approaches of collaborative filtering, which are memory-based and model-based, using data sample of PT X e-commerce. The performance of each approach was evaluated using offline testing and user-based testing. The result of this study indicates that the model-based recommender system is better than memory-based recommender system in three aspects: a) the accuracy of recommendation, b) computation time, and c) the relevance of recommendation. For number of transaction less than 300,000 in database, respondents perceived that the computation time of memory-based recommender system is tolerable, even though the computational time is longer than model-based."

Typical characteristics include: Only positive examples can be observed, classes are highly imbalanced, and the vast majority of data points are missing. The idea of introducing weights for missing parts of a matrix has recently been shown to help in OCCF. While existing weighting approaches mitigate the first two problems above, a sparsity preserving solution that would allow to efficiently utilize data sets with e.g., hundred thousands of users and items has not yet been reported. In this paper, we study three different collaborative filtering frameworks: Low-rank matrix approximation, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, and maximum-margin matrix factorization. We propose two novel algorithms for large-scale OCCF that allow to weight the unknowns. Our experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency on different problems, including the Netflix Prize data."

    "title": "A Consensus-Driven Group Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems aim at filtering large amounts of information for users, providing them with those pieces of information which better meet their preferences or needs. Such systems have been traditionally used in diverse areas, such as e-commerce or tourism. Within this context, group recommender systems address the problem of generating recommendations for groups of users who might have different interests. Although different aggregation processes have been extensively utilized in real-life applications to generate group recommendations, such processes do not guarantee that the list of products recommended to the group reflect a high agreement level among its members' individual preferences. Given the need for considering the added value of obtaining group recommendations under a high agreement level, this paper presents a novel group recommender system methodology that attempts to reach a high level of consensus among individual recommendations of group members. To do this, and inspired by existing group decision-making approaches in the literature, a consensus reaching process is carried out to bring such individual recommendations closer to each other before delivering the group recommendations."

    "abstract": "Rigorous evidence identification is essential for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (evidence syntheses) because the sample selection of relevant studies determines a review's outcome, validity, and explanatory power. Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis."

    "abstract": "Recommendation serendipity is being increasingly recognized as being equally important as the other beyond-accuracy objectives (such as novelty and diversity), in eliminating the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d phenomenon of the traditional recommender systems. However, little work has empirically verified the effects of serendipity on increasing user satisfaction and behavioral intention. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale user survey (involving over 3,000 users) conducted in an industrial mobile e-commerce setting. The study has identified the significant causal relationships from novelty, unexpectedness, relevance, and timeliness to serendipity, and from serendipity to user satisfaction and purchase intention. Moreover, our findings reveal that user curiosity plays a moderating role in strengthening the relationships from novelty to serendipity and from serendipity to satisfaction. Our third contribution lies in the comparison of several recommender algorithms, which demonstrates the significant improvements of the serendipity-oriented algorithm over the relevance- and novelty-oriented approaches in terms of user perceptions. We finally discuss the implications of this experiment, which include the feasibility of developing a more precise metric for measuring recommendation serendipity, and the potential benefit of a curiosity-based personalized serendipity strategy for recommender systems."

Prior systems have made attempts to implement solutions to this problem, but few systems have undergone systematic user evaluation. This work describes a systematic evaluation of the Expertise Recommender (ER), a system that recommends people who are likely to have expertise in a specific problem. ER and the organizational context for which it was designed are described to provide a basis for understanding this evaluation. Prior to conducting the evaluation, a baseline experiment showed that people are relatively good at judging coworkers' expertise when given an appropriate context. This finding provides a way to demonstrate the effectiveness of ER by comparing ER's performance to ratings by coworkers. The evaluation, the design, and results are described in detail. The results suggest that the participants agree with the recommendations made by ER, and that ER significantly outperforms other expertise recommender systems when compared using similar metrics."

    "abstract": "Abstract Resilience is widely seen as a desirable system property in environmental management. This paper explores the concept of resilience to natural hazards, using weather-related hazards in coastal megacities as an example. The paper draws on the wide literature on megacities, coastal hazards, hazard risk reduction strategies, and resilience within environmental management. Some analysts define resilience as a system attribute, whilst others use it as an umbrella concept for a range of system attributes deemed desirable. These umbrella concepts have not been made operational to support planning or management. It is recommended that resilience only be used in a restricted sense to describe specific system attributes concerning (i) the amount of disturbance a system can absorb and still remain within the same state or domain of attraction and (ii) the degree to which the system is capable of self-organisation. The concept of adaptive capacity, which has emerged in the context of climate change, can then be adopted as the umbrella concept, where resilience will be one factor influencing adaptive capacity. This improvement to conceptual clarity would foster much-needed communication between the natural hazards and the climate change communities and, more importantly, offers greater potential in application, especially when attempting to move away from disaster recovery to hazard prediction, disaster prevention, and preparedness."

    "title": "Increasing temporal diversity with purchase intervals",
    "abstract": "The development of Web 2.0 technology has led to huge economic benefits and challenges for both e-commerce websites and online shoppers. One core technology to increase sales and consumers' satisfaction is the use of recommender systems. Existing product recommender systems consider the order of items purchased by users to obtain a list of recommended items. However, they do not consider the time interval between the products purchased. For example, there is often an interval of 2-3 months between the purchase of printer ink cartridges or refills. Thus, recommending appropriate ink cartridges one week before the user needs to replace the depleted ink cartridges would increase the likelihood of a purchase decision. In this paper, we propose to utilize the purchase interval information to improve the performance of the recommender systems for e-commerce. We design an efficient algorithm to compute the purchase intervals between product pairs from users' purchase history and integrate this information into the marginal utility model. We evaluate our approach on a real world ecommerce dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the conversion rate and temporal diversity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms."

The data is exploited to make informed choices, predict marketplace trends and patterns in consumer preferences. Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous after the penetration of internet services among the masses. The idea is to make use of filtering and clustering techniques to suggest items of interest to users. For a media commodity like movies, suggestions are made to users by finding user profiles of individuals with similar tastes. Initially, user preference is obtained by letting them rate movies of their choice. Upon usage, the recommender system will be able to understand the user better and suggest movies that are more likely to be rated higher. The experiment results on the MovieLens dataset provides a reliable model which is precise and generates more personalised movie recommendations compared to other models."

Current research on recommender systems mostly focuses on matching users with proper items based on user interests. However, significant efforts are missing to understand how the recommendations influence user preferences and behaviors, e.g., if and how recommendations result in \\textit{echo chambers}. Extensive efforts have been made in examining the phenomenon in online media and social network systems. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns that recommender systems might lead to the self-reinforcing of user's interests due to narrowed exposure of items, which may be the potential cause of echo chamber. In this paper, we aim to analyze the echo chamber phenomenon in Alibaba Taobao -- one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. Echo chamber means the effect of user interests being reinforced through repeated exposure to similar contents. Based on the definition, we examine the presence of echo chamber in two steps. First, we explore whether user interests have been reinforced. Second, we check whether the reinforcement results from the exposure of similar contents. Our evaluations are enhanced with robust metrics, including cluster validity and statistical significance. Experiments are performed on extensive collections of real-world data consisting of user clicks, purchases, and browse logs from Alibaba Taobao. Evidence suggests the tendency of echo chamber in user click behaviors, while it is relatively mitigated in user purchase behaviors. Insights from the results guide the refinement of recommendation algorithms in real-world e-commerce systems."

Recommenders use community opinion histories to help users identify interesting items from a considerably large search space (e.g., inventory from Amazon [7], movies from Netflix [9]). Personalization, recommendation, and the \u201chuman side of data-centric applications are even becoming important topics in the data management community [3]. A popular recommendation method used heavily in practice is collaborative filtering, consisting of two phases: (1) An offline model-building phase that uses community opinions of items (e.g., movie ratings, \u201cDiggs\u201d [6]) to build a model storing meaningful correlations between users and items. (2) An on-demand recommendation phase that uses the model to produce a set of recommended items when requested from a user or application. To be effective, recommender systems must evolve with their content. In current update-intensive systems (e.g., social networks, online news sites), the restriction that a model be generated offline is a significant drawback, as it hinders the system\u2019s ability to evolve quickly. For instance, new users enter the system changing the collective opinions over items, or the system adds new items quickly (e.g., news posts, Facebook postings), which widens the recommendation pool.

    "abstract": "Online news recommender systems aim to address the information explosion of news and make personalized recommendation for users. In general, news language is highly condensed, full of knowledge entities and common sense. However, existing methods are unaware of such external knowledge and cannot fully discover latent knowledge-level connections among news. The recommended results for a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended reasonably. Moreover, news recommendation also faces the challenges of high time-sensitivity of news and dynamic diversity of users' interests. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network (DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news recommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for click-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and word-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that fuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats words and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment relationship during convolution. In addition, to address users' diverse interests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a user's history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive experiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models. We also validate the efficacy of the usage of knowledge in DKN."

    "title": "A source independent framework for research paper recommendation",
    "abstract": "As the number of research papers available on the Web has increased enormously over the years, paper recommender systems have been proposed to help researchers on automatically finding works of interest. The main problem with the current approaches is that they assume that recommending algorithms are provided with a rich set of evidence (e.g., document collections, citations, profiles) which is normally not widely available. In this paper we propose a novel source independent framework for research paper recommendation. The framework requires as input only a single research paper and generates several potential queries by using terms in that paper, which are then submitted to existing Web information sources that hold research papers. Once a set of candidate papers for recommendation is generated, the framework applies content-based recommending algorithms to rank the candidates in order to recommend the ones most related to the input paper. This is done by using only publicly available metadata (i.e., title and abstract). We evaluate our proposed framework by performing an extensive experimentation in which we analyzed several strategies for query generation and several ranking strategies for paper recommendation. Our results show that good recommendations can be obtained with simple and low cost strategies."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems selectively circulate information enriched with comments and feedback based on people's experience. These systems filter information in a semi-automatic and high-quality way in order to support a community during their work or leisure practices. However recommender systems are usually separate tools that require a degree of effort to be used, both when receiving information and to insert new feedback. In this paper we present our informal experiences with the use of multiple user interfaces (interactive large screen, email, paper and PDA) as means to improve the diffusion of information through an organizational unit and to improve access to information stored within an existing recommender system"

    "title": "Improving the prediction accuracy of recommendation algorithms: Approaches anchored on human factors",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are a special class of personalized systems that aim at predicting a user\u2019s interest on available products and services by relying on previously rated items or item features. Human factors associated with a user\u2019s personality or lifestyle, although potential determinants of user behavior are rarely considered in the personalization process. In this paper, we demonstrate how the concept of lifestyle can be incorporated in the recommendation process to improve the prediction accuracy by efficiently managing the problem of limited data availability. We propose two approaches: one relying on lifestyle alone and another integrating lifestyle within the nearest neighbor approach. Both approaches are empirically tested in the domain of recommendations for personalized television advertisements and are shown to outperform existing nearest neighborhood approaches in most cases."

    "title": "The Adaptive Clustering Method for the Long Tail Problem of Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "This is a study of the long tail problem of recommender systems when many items in the long tail have only a few ratings, thus making it hard to use them in recommender systems. The approach presented in this paper clusters items according to their popularities, so that the recommendations for tail items are based on the ratings in more intensively clustered groups and for the head items are based on the ratings of individual items or groups, clustered to a lesser extent. We apply this method to two real-life data sets and compare the results with those of the nongrouping and fully grouped methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and scalability. The results show that if such adaptive clustering is done properly, this method reduces the recommendation error rates for the tail items, while maintaining reasonable computational performance."

Currently, collaborative filtering is probably the most known and commonly used recommendation approach in recommender systems. In this paper, we present a new genetic algorithms-based recommender system, SimGen, that computes the similarity values between users without using any of the well-known similarity metric calculation algorithms like Pearson correlation and vector cosine-based similarity. The results obtained present 46% and 38% improvements in prediction quality and performance, respectively when compared with other techniques."

    "title": "Towards Question-based Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Conversational and question-based recommender systems have gained increasing attention in recent years, with users enabled to converse with the system and better control recommendations. Nevertheless, research in the field is still limited, compared to traditional recommender systems. In this work, we propose a novel Question-based recommendation method, Qrec, to assist users to find items interactively, by answering automatically constructed and algorithmically chosen questions. Previous conversational recommender systems ask users to express their preferences over items or item facets. Our model, instead, asks users to express their preferences over descriptive item features. The model is first trained offline by a novel matrix factorization algorithm, and then iteratively updates the user and item latent factors online by a closed-form solution based on the user answers. Meanwhile, our model infers the underlying user belief and preferences over items to learn an optimal question-asking strategy by using Generalized Binary Search, so as to ask a sequence of questions to the user. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed matrix factorization model outperforms the traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model. Further, our proposed Qrec model can greatly improve the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, and it is also effective in the case of cold-start user and item recommendations."

    "abstract": "Trust in a Recommender System (RS) is crucial for its overall success. However, it remains underexplored whether users trust personal recommendation sources (i.e. other humans) more than impersonal sources (i.e. conventional RS), and, if they do, whether the perceived quality of explanation provided account for the difference. We conducted an empirical study in which we compared these two sources of recommendations and explanations. Human advisors were asked to explain movies they recommended in short texts while the RS created explanations based on item similarity. Our experiment comprised two rounds of recommending. Over both rounds the quality of explanations provided by users was assessed higher than the quality of the system's explanations. Moreover, explanation quality significantly influenced perceived recommendation quality as well as trust in the recommendation source. Consequently, we suggest that RS should provide richer explanations in order to increase their perceived recommendation quality and trustworthiness."

    "abstract": "Since benchmarks drive computer science research and industry product development, which ones we use and how we evaluate them are key questions for the community. Despite complex runtime tradeoffs due to dynamic compilation and garbage collection required for Java programs, many evaluations still use methodologies developed for C, C++, and Fortran. SPEC, the dominant purveyor of benchmarks, compounded this problem by institutionalizing these methodologies for their Java benchmark suite. This paper recommends benchmarking selection and evaluation methodologies, and introduces the DaCapo benchmarks, a set of open source, client-side Java benchmarks. We demonstrate that the complex interactions of (1) architecture, (2) compiler, (3) virtual machine, (4) memory management, and (5) application require more extensive evaluation than C, C++, and Fortran which stress (4) much less, and do not require (3). We use and introduce new value, time-series, and statistical metrics for static and dynamic properties such as code complexity, code size, heap composition, and pointer mutations. No benchmark suite is definitive, but these metrics show that DaCapo improves over SPEC Java in a variety of ways, including more complex code, richer object behaviors, and more demanding memory system requirements. This paper takes a step towards improving methodologies for choosing and evaluating benchmarks to foster innovation in system design and implementation for Java and other managed languages."

    "title": "Feature-based recommendation system",
    "abstract": "The explosive growth of the world-wide-web and the emergence of e-commerce has led to the development of recommender systems--a personalized information filtering technology used to identify a set of N items that will be of interest to a certain user. User-based and model-based collaborative filtering are the most successful technology for building recommender systems to date and is extensively used in many commercial recommender systems. The basic assumption in these algorithms is that there are sufficient historical data for measuring similarity between products or users. However, this assumption does not hold in various application domains such as electronics retail, home shopping network, on-line retail where new products are introduced and existing products disappear from the catalog. Another such application domains is home improvement retail industry where a lot of products (such as window treatments, bathroom, kitchen or deck) are custom made. Each product is unique and there are very little duplicate products. In this domain, the probability of the same exact two products bought together is close to zero. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of providing recommendation in the domains where no sufficient historical data exist for measuring similarity between products or users. We present feature-based recommendation algorithms that overcome the limitations of the existing top-n recommendation algorithms. The experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms in the real life data sets shows a great promise. The pilot project deploying the proposed feature-based recommendation algorithms in the on-line retail web site shows 75% increase in the recommendation revenue for the first 2 month period."

There are numerous information on internet and so many visitors on websites which add some challenges for generating recommender system. A recommender system extracts the user preferences or interests from the related data sets so there is low information overload. Therefore, new recommendation system is required which will provide more quality recommendations for huge data sets. So, for these types of issues we have discovered several techniques of recommendation techniques which are three types such as: Content-based filtering, Collaborative filtering and Hybrid filtering.

Although it has been extensively studied over decades and has achieved notable success in improving user experience, there are still many problems and challenges that need to be further studied. To help researchers master the advances in personalized news recommendation, in this article, we present a comprehensive overview of personalized news recommendation. Instead of following the conventional taxonomy of news recommendation methods, in this article, we propose a novel perspective to understand personalized news recommendation based on its core problems and the associated techniques and challenges. We first review the techniques for tackling each core problem in a personalized news recommender system and the challenges they face. Next, we introduce the public datasets and evaluation methods for personalized news recommendation. We then discuss the key points on improving the responsibility of personalized news recommender systems. Finally, we raise several research directions that are worth investigating in the future. This article can provide up-to-date and comprehensive views on personalized news recommendation. We hope this article can facilitate research on personalized news recommendation as well as related fields in natural language processing and data mining."

    "abstract": "Information overload is no longer news; the explosive growth of the Internet has made this issue increasingly serious for Web users. Users are very often overwhelmed by the huge amount of information and are faced with a big challenge to find the most relevant information in the right time. Recommender systems aim at pruning this information space and directing users toward the items that best meet their needs and interests. Web Recommendation has been an active application area in Web Mining and Machine Learning research. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning perspective toward the problem, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike other recommender systems, our system does not use the static patterns discovered from web usage data, instead it learns to make recommendations as the actions it performs in each situation. We model the problem as Q-Learning while employing concepts and techniques commonly applied in the web usage mining domain. We propose that the reinforcement learning paradigm provides an appropriate model for the recommendation problem, as well as a framework in which the system constantly interacts with the user and learns from her behavior. Our experimental evaluations support our claims and demonstrate how this approach can improve the quality of web recommendations."

A commonly overlooked aspect of evaluating recommender systems is the selection of the data splitting strategy. In this paper, we both show that there is no standard splitting strategy and that the selection of splitting strategy can have a strong impact on the ranking of recommender systems during evaluation. In particular, we perform experiments comparing three common data splitting strategies, examining their impact over seven state-of-the-art recommendation models on two datasets. Our results demonstrate that the splitting strategy employed is an important confounding variable that can markedly alter the ranking of recommender systems, making much of the currently published literature non-comparable, even when the same datasets and metrics are used."

The consensus views of the Working Group are presented here. The term, \u2018potentially malignant disorders\u2019, was recommended to refer to precancer as it conveys that not all disorders described under this term may transform into cancer. Critically evaluating all definitions proposed so far for oral leukoplakia, the Working Group agreed that the term leukoplakia should be used to recognize \u2018white plaques of questionable risk having excluded (other) known diseases or disorders that carry no increased risk for cancer\u2019. An outline was proposed for diagnosing oral leukoplakia that will prevent other oral white disorders being misclassified as leukoplakia. The Working Group discussed the caveats involved in the current use of terminology and classification of oral potentially malignant disorders, deficiencies of these complex systems, and how they have evolved over the past several decades. The terminology presented in this report reflects our best understanding of multi\u2010step carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa, and aspires to engender consistency in use."

Recently, an information-theoretic co-clustering approach applicable to empirical joint probability distributions was proposed. In many situations, co-clustering of more general matrices is desired. In this paper, we present a substantially generalized co-clustering framework wherein any Bregman divergence can be used in the objective function, and various conditional expectation based constraints can be considered based on the statistics that need to be preserved. Analysis of the co-clustering problem leads to the minimum Bregman information principle, which generalizes the maximum entropy principle, and yields an elegant meta algorithm that is guaranteed to achieve local optimality. Our methodology yields new algorithms and also encompasses several previously known clustering and co-clustering algorithms based on alternate minimization."

    "title": "A theory of organizational readiness for change",
    "abstract": "Change management experts have emphasized the importance of establishing organizational readiness for change and recommended various strategies for creating it. Although the advice seems reasonable, the scientific basis for it is limited. Unlike individual readiness for change, organizational readiness for change has not been subject to extensive theoretical development or empirical study. In this article, I conceptually define organizational readiness for change and develop a theory of its determinants and outcomes. I focus on the organizational level of analysis because many promising approaches to improving healthcare delivery entail collective behavior change in the form of systems redesign--that is, multiple, simultaneous changes in staffing, work flow, decision making, communication, and reward systems.Organizational readiness for change is a multi-level, multi-faceted construct. As an organization-level construct, readiness for change refers to organizational members' shared resolve to implement a change (change commitment) and shared belief in their collective capability to do so (change efficacy). Organizational readiness for change varies as a function of how much organizational members value the change and how favorably they appraise three key determinants of implementation capability: task demands, resource availability, and situational factors. When organizational readiness for change is high, organizational members are more likely to initiate change, exert greater effort, exhibit greater persistence, and display more cooperative behavior. The result is more effective implementation.The theory described in this article treats organizational readiness as a shared psychological state in which organizational members feel committed to implementing an organizational change and confident in their collective abilities to do so. This way of thinking about organizational readiness is best suited for examining organizational changes where collective behavior change is necessary in order to effectively implement the change and, in some instances, for the change to produce anticipated benefits. Testing the theory would require further measurement development and careful sampling decisions. The theory offers a means of reconciling the structural and psychological views of organizational readiness found in the literature. Further, the theory suggests the possibility that the strategies that change management experts recommend are equifinal. That is, there is no 'one best way' to increase organizational readiness for change."

    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems predict user preferences for online information, products or services by learning from past user-item relationships. A predominant approach to Collaborative Filtering is Neighborhood-based, where a user-item preference rating is computed from ratings of similar items and/or users. This approach encounters data sparsity and scalability limitations as the volume of accessible information and the active users continue to grow leading to performance degradation, poor quality recommendations and inaccurate predictions. Despite these drawbacks, the problem of information overload has led to great interests in personalization techniques. The incorporation of context information and Matrix and Tensor Factorization techniques have proved to be a promising solution to some of these challenges. We conducted a focused review of literature in the areas of Context-aware Recommender Systems utilizing Matrix Factorization approaches. This survey paper presents a detailed literature review of Context-aware Recommender Systems and approaches to improving performance for large scale datasets and the impact of incorporating contextual information on the quality and accuracy of the recommendation. The results of this survey can be used as a basic reference for improving and optimizing existing Context-aware Collaborative Filtering based Recommender Systems.

In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler\u2013Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. We evaluate our approach on three different tasks: (i) standard machine learning tasks, (ii) entity and document modeling, and (iii) content-based recommender systems. The evaluation shows that the proposed entity embeddings outperform existing techniques, and that pre-computed feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks."

    "title": "Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Reasoning for Eliminating Popularity Bias in Recommender System",
    "abstract": "The general aim of the recommender system is to provide personalized suggestions to users, which is opposed to suggesting popular items. However, the normal training paradigm, i.e., fitting a recommender model to recover the user behavior data with pointwise or pairwise loss, makes the model biased towards popular items. This results in the terrible Matthew effect, making popular items be more frequently recommended and become even more popular. Existing work addresses this issue with Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW), which decreases the impact of popular items on the training and increases the impact of long-tail items. Although theoretically sound, IPW methods are highly sensitive to the weighting strategy, which is notoriously difficult to tune. In this work, we explore the popularity bias issue from a novel and fundamental perspective -- cause-effect. We identify that popularity bias lies in the direct effect from the item node to the ranking score, such that an item's intrinsic property is the cause of mistakenly assigning it a higher ranking score. To eliminate popularity bias, it is essential to answer the counterfactual question that what the ranking score would be if the model only uses item property. To this end, we formulate a causal graph to describe the important cause-effect relations in the recommendation process. During training, we perform multi-task learning to achieve the contribution of each cause; during testing, we perform counterfactual inference to remove the effect of item popularity. Remarkably, our solution amends the learning process of recommendation which is agnostic to a wide range of models -- it can be easily implemented in existing methods. We demonstrate it on Matrix Factorization (MF) and LightGCN [20]. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

However, previously proposed cross-domain models did not take into account bidirectional latent relations between users and items. In addition, they do not explicitly model information of user and item features, while utilizing only user ratings information for recommendations. To address these concerns, in this paper we propose a novel approach to cross-domain recommendations based on the mechanism of dual learning that transfers information between two related domains in an iterative manner until the learning process stabilizes. We develop a novel latent orthogonal mapping to extract user preferences over multiple domains while preserving relations between users across different latent spaces. Combining with autoencoder approach to extract the latent essence of feature information, we propose Deep Dual Transfer Cross Domain Recommendation (DDTCDR) model to provide recommendations in respective domains. We test the proposed method on a large dataset containing three domains of movies, book and music items and demonstrate that it consistently and significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines and also classical transfer learning approaches."

We compare different strategies for creating user profiles based on the Twitter messages a user has published and study how these profiles change over time. Moreover, we evaluate the quality of the user modeling strategies in the context of personalized recommender systems and show that those strategies which consider the temporal dynamics of the individual profiles allow for the best performance."

Such scenarios are commonplace in web applications like content recommendation, ad targeting and web search where items are articles, ads and web pages respectively. Because of data sparseness, regularization is key to good predictive accuracy. Our method works by regularizing both user and item factors simultaneously through user features and the bag of words associated with each item. Specifically, each word in an item is associated with a discrete latent factor often referred to as the topic of the word; item topics are obtained by averaging topics across all words in an item. Then, user rating on an item is modeled as user's affinity to the item's topics where user affinity to topics (user factors) and topic assignments to words in items (item factors) are learned jointly in a supervised fashion. To avoid overfitting, user and item factors are regularized through Gaussian linear regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) priors respectively. We show our model is accurate, interpretable and handles both cold-start and warm-start scenarios seamlessly through a single model. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a new dataset from Yahoo! Buzz where fLDA provides superior predictive accuracy in cold-start scenarios and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in warm-start scenarios. As a by-product, fLDA also identifies interesting topics that explains user-item interactions. Our method also generalizes a recently proposed technique called supervised LDA (sLDA) to collaborative filtering applications. While sLDA estimates item topic vectors in a supervised fashion for a single regression, fLDA incorporates multiple regressions (one for each user) in estimating the item factors."

    "abstract": "Interest in the surgical treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis has increased, primarily because rigid endoscopy and, more particularly, computed tomographic scanning have facilitated the visualization of disease. At the same time it has become both scientifically and financially imperative to audit therapeutic outcome. Consequently, a staging system for nonneoplastic sinus disease is needed. It is clear that any assessment of medical or surgical therapeutic response requires a method of quantifying disease severity that will be widely accepted by practitioners in the field. This acceptance will largely depend on how easy the method is to apply. With computed tomographic scanning it is possible to more accurately determine the extent of the pathologic condition in rhinosinusitis, a disease in which the severity of symptoms and the appearances on nasal endoscopy have a significantly more unpredictable correlation with the extent of disease. One goal of the Task Force on Rhinosinusitis of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was to recommend a system for outcomes research that combines quantification with ease of application."

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering algorithms, such as matrix factorization techniques, are recently gaining momentum due to their promising performance on recommender systems. However, most collaborative filtering algorithms suffer from data sparsity. Active learning algorithms are effective in reducing the sparsity problem for recommender systems by requesting users to give ratings to some items when they enter the systems. In this paper, a new matrix factorization model, called Enhanced SVD (ESVD) is proposed, which incorporates the classic matrix factorization algorithms with ratings completion inspired by active learning. In addition, the connection between the prediction accuracy and the density of matrix is built to further explore its potentials. We also propose the Multi-layer ESVD, which learns the model iteratively to further improve the prediction accuracy. To handle the imbalanced data sets that contain far more users than items or more items than users, the Item-wise ESVD and User-wise ESVD are presented, respectively. The proposed methods are evaluated on the famous Netflix and Movielens data sets. Experimental results validate their effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and efficiency when compared with traditional matrix factorization methods and active learning methods."

Expanded Discussion of What\u2019s New in the Guideline S43Preamble and Transition to ACC/AHA Guidelines to Reduce Cardiovascular RiskThe goals of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) are to prevent cardiovascular diseases; improve the management of people who have these diseases through professional education and research; and develop guidelines, standards, and policies that promote optimal patient care and cardiovascular health. Toward these objectives, the ACC and AHA have collaborated with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and stakeholder and professional organizations to develop clinical practice guidelines for assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood cholesterol in adults, and management of overweight and obesity in adults.In 2008, the NHLBI initiated these guidelines by sponsoring rigorous systematic evidence reviews for each topic by expert panels convened to develop critical questions (CQs), interpret the evidence, and craft recommendations. In response to the 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine on the development of trustworthy clinical guidelines,1 the NHLBI Advisory Council recommended that the NHLBI focus specifically on reviewing the highest-quality evidence and partner with other organizations to develop recommendations.2,3 Accordingly, in June 2013 the NHLBI initiated collaboration with the ACC and AHA to work with other organizations to complete and publish the 4 guidelines noted above and make them available to the widest possible constituency. Recognizing that the Expert Panels/Work Groups did not consider evidence beyond 2011 (except as specified in the methodology), the ACC, AHA, and collaborating societies plan to begin updating these guidelines starting in 2014.The joint ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force) appointed a subcommittee to shepherd this transition, communicate the rationale and expectations to the writing panels and partnering organizations, and expeditiously publish the documents. The ACC/AHA and partner organizations recruited a limited number of expert reviewers for fiduciary examination of content, recognizing that each document had undergone extensive peer review by representatives of the NHLBI Advisory Council, key federal agencies, and scientific experts. Each writing panel responded to comments from these reviewers. Clarifications were incorporated where appropriate, but there were no substantive changes because the bulk of the content was undisputed.Although the Task Force led the final development of these prevention guidelines, they differ from other ACC/AHA guidelines. First, as opposed to an extensive compendium of clinical information, these documents are significantly more limited in scope and focus on selected CQs on each topic, based on the highest-quality evidence available. Recommendations were derived from randomized trials, meta-analyses, and observational studies evaluated for quality and were not formulated when sufficient evidence was not available. Second, the text accompanying each recommendation is succinct, summarizing the evidence for each question. The Full Panel/Work Group Reports include more detailed information about the evidence statements that serve as the basis for recommendations. Third, the format of the recommendations differs from other ACC/AHA guidelines. Each recommendation has been mapped from the NHLBI grading format to the ACC/AHA Classification of Recommendation/Level of Evidence (COR/LOE) construct (Table 1) and is expressed in both formats. Because of the inherent differences in grading systems and the clinical questions driving the recommendations, alignment between the NHLBI and ACC/AHA formats is in some cases imperfect. Explanations of these variations are noted in the recommendation tables, where applicable.Table 1. Applying Classification of Recommendation and Level of EvidenceTable 1. Applying Classification of Recommendation and Level of EvidenceIn consultation with NHLBI, the policies adopted by the writing panels to manage relationships of authors with industry and other entities (RWI) are outlined in the methods section of each panel report. These policies were in effect when this effort began in 2008 and throughout the writing process and voting on recommendations, until the process was transferred to ACC/AHA in 2013. In the interest of transparency, the ACC/AHA requested that panel authors resubmit RWI disclosures as of July 2013. Relationships relevant to this guideline are disclosed in Appendix 1. None of the ACC/AHA expert reviewers had relevant RWI (Appendix 2). See Appendix 3 for a list of abbreviations used in the guideline.Systematic evidence reports and accompanying summary tables were developed by the expert panels and NHLBI. The guideline was reviewed by the ACC/AHA Task Force and approved by the ACC Board of Trustees, and the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. In addition, ACC/AHA sought endorsement from other stakeholders, including professional organizations. It is the hope of the writing panels, stakeholders, professional organizations, NHLBI, and Task Force that the guidelines will garner the widest possible readership for the benefit of patients, providers, and the public health.These guidelines are meant to define practices that meet the needs of patients in most circumstances and are not a replacement for clinical judgment. The ultimate decision about care of a particular patient must be made by the healthcare provider and patient in light of the circumstances presented by that patient. As a result, situations might arise in which deviations from these guidelines may be appropriate. These considerations notwithstanding, in caring for most patients, clinicians can employ the recommendations confidently to reduce the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events.See Tables 1a and 1b for an explanation of the NHLBI recommendation grading methodology.Table 1a. NHLBI Grading of the Strength of RecommendationsGradeStrength of Recommendation*AStrong recommendationThere is high certainty based on evidence that the net benefit\u2021 is substantial.BModerate recommendationThere is moderate certainty based on evidence that the net benefit is moderate to substantial, or there is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate.CWeak recommendationThere is at least moderate certainty based on evidence that there is a small net benefit.DRecommendation againstThere is at least moderate certainty based on evidence that there is no net benefit or that risks/harms outweigh benefits.EExpert opinion (\u201cThere is insufficient evidence or evidence is unclear or conflicting, but this is what the Work Group recommends.\u201d)Net benefit is unclear. Balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined because of no evidence, insufficient evidence, unclear evidence, or conflicting evidence, but the Work Group thought it was important to provide clinical guidance and make a recommendation. Further research is recommended in this area.NNo recommendation for or against (\u201cThere is insufficient evidence or evidence is unclear or conflicting.\u201d)Net benefit is unclear. Balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined because of no evidence, insufficient evidence, unclear evidence, or conflicting evidence, and the Work Group thought no recommendation should be made. Further research is recommended in this area.*In most cases, the strength of the recommendation should be closely aligned with the quality of the evidence; however, under some circumstances, there may be valid reasons for making recommendations that are not closely aligned with the quality of the evidence (eg, strong recommendation when the evidence quality is moderate, such as smoking cessation to reduce cardiovascular disease risk or ordering an ECG as part of the initial diagnostic work-up for a patient presenting with possible MI). Those situations should be limited and the rationale explained clearly by the Work Group.\u2020Net benefit is defined as benefits minus risks/harms of the service/intervention.ECG indicates electrocardiogram; MI, myocardial infarction; and NHLBI, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.Table 1b.

In such cases, the rationale for the evidence rating exception should be explained by the Work Group and clearly justified.\u2020\u201cWell-designed, well-executed\u201d refers to studies that directly address the question; use adequate randomization, blinding, and allocation concealment; are adequately powered; use intention-to-treat analyses; and have high follow-up rates.\u2021Limitations include concerns with the design and execution of a study that result in decreased confidence in the true estimate of the effect. Examples of such limitations include but are not limited to: inadequate randomization, lack of blinding of study participants or outcome assessors, inadequate power, outcomes of interest that are not prespecified for the primary outcomes, low follow-up rates, and findings based on subgroup analyses. Whether the limitations are considered minor or major is based on the number and severity of flaws in design or execution. Rules for determining whether the limitations are considered minor or major and how they will affect rating of the individual studies will be developed collaboratively with the methodology team.\u00a7Nonrandomized controlled studies refer to intervention studies where assignment to intervention and comparison groups is not random (eg, quasi-experimental study design).\u2016Observational studies include prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.NHLBI indicates National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and RCT, randomized controlled trials.1. Introduction1.1. Organization of the PanelThe Blood Cholesterol Expert Panel (Expert Panel) was originally convened as the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel IV) appointed by the NHLBI. The Expert Panel was composed of 13 members and 3 ex-officio members, which included primary care physicians, cardiologists, endocrinologists, and experts in clinical lipidology, clinical trials, cardiovascular epidemiology and nutrition, and guideline development. The Expert Panel chair asked all panel members to disclose any conflict-of-interest information to the full panel in advance of the deliberations; members with conflicts were asked to recuse themselves from voting on any aspect of the guideline for which a conflict might exist. All 16 members of the NHLBI Adult Treatment Panel IV Panel transitioned to the ACC/AHA guideline Expert Panel. Independent contractors performed the systematic review with the assistance of the Expert Panel and provided methodological guidance to the Expert Panel.1.2. Document Review and ApprovalA formal peer review process was initially completed under the auspices of the NHLBI and included 23 expert reviewers and representatives of federal agencies. This document was also reviewed by 4 expert reviewers nominated by the ACC and the AHA when the management of the guideline transitioned to the ACC/AHA. The ACC and AHA reviewers\u2019 RWI information is published in this document (Appendix 2).This document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC and AHA and endorsed by the American Academy of Physician Assistants, American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, American Pharmacists Association, American Society for Preventive Cardiology, Association of Black Cardiologists, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, and WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease.1.3. Scope of GuidelineThis guideline is based on the Full Panel Report, which is provided as an online-only data supplement to the guideline. The Full Panel Report contains background and additional material related to content, methodology, evidence synthesis, rationale, and references and is supported by the NHLBI Systematic Evidence Review, which can be found at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/ser/. Table 2 provides an overview to facilitate understanding what is new in the present guideline.Table 2. What\u2019s New in the Guideline?*Focus on ASCVD Risk Reduction: 4 Statin Benefit GroupsThis guideline is based on a comprehensive set of data from RCTs from which 4 statin benefit groups were identified that focus efforts to reduce ASCVD events in secondary and primary prevention.This guideline identifies high-intensity and moderate-intensity statin therapy for use in secondary and primary prevention.A New Perspective on LDL-C and/or Non\u2013HDL-C Treatment GoalsThe Expert Panel was unable to find RCT evidence to support continued use of specific LDL-C or non\u2013HDL-C treatment targets.The appropriate intensity of statin therapy should be used to reduce ASCVD risk in those most likely to benefit.Nonstatin therapies, as compared with statin therapy, do not provide acceptable ASCVD risk-reduction benefits relative to their potential for adverse effects in the routine prevention of ASCVD.Global Risk Assessment for Primary PreventionThis guideline recommends use of the new Pooled Cohort Equations to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk in both white and black men and women.By more accurately identifying higher-risk individuals for statin therapy, the guideline focuses statin therapy on those most likely to benefit.It also indicates, on the basis of RCT data, those high-risk groups that might not benefit.This guideline recommends a discussion between clinicians and patients before initiation of statin therapy.Safety RecommendationsThis guideline used RCTs to identify important safety considerations in individuals receiving treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk.Using RCTs to determine statin adverse effects facilitates understanding of the net benefit from statin therapy.This guideline provides expert guidance on management of statin-associated adverse effects, including muscle symptoms.Role of Biomarkers and Noninvasive TestsTreatment decisions in selected individuals who are not included in the 4 statin benefit groups may be informed by other factors as recommended by the Risk Assessment Work Group and Blood Cholesterol Expert Panel.Future Updates to the Blood Cholesterol GuidelineThis is a comprehensive guideline for the evidence-based treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk.Future updates will build on this foundation to provide expert guidance on the management of complex lipid disorders and incorporate refinements in risk stratification based on critical review of emerging data.RCTs comparing alternative treatment strategies are needed in order to inform future evidence-based guidelines for the optimum ASCVD risk-reduction approach.*See Appendix 5, for an expanded discussion of what\u2019s new in the guideline.ASCVD indicates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and RCT, randomized controlled trial.The Expert Panel was charged with using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs to update the clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of blood cholesterol levels to reduce ASCVD risk. For this guideline, ASCVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, all of presumed atherosclerotic origin. These recommendations are intended to provide a strong, evidence-based foundation for the treatment of cholesterol for the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD in women and men.Because RCT data were used to identify those most likely to benefit from cholesterol-lowering statin therapy, the recommendations will be of value to primary care clinicians as well as specialists concerned with ASCVD prevention. Importantly, the recommendations were designed to be easy to use in the clinical setting, facilitating the implementation of a strategy of risk assessment and treatment focused on the prevention of ASCVD. The present guideline is intended to address treatment of adults (\u226521 years of age) to complement the NHLBI cardiovascular health risk-reduction guideline for children and adolescents.4The members of the Expert Panel acknowledge the important contributions arising from decades of genetic and biochemical studies, observational epidemiological and ecological studies, and in vitro and animal experiments that associated higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with greater ASCVD risk. These studies provided the rationale for RCTs, which in turn demonstrated that lowering cholesterol levels reduced ASCVD events and thereby established a central, causal role of atherogenic cholesterol-containing lipoprotein particles, particularly LDL, in the genesis of CHD and ASCVD.Other strategies for using drug therapy to reduce ASCVD events have been advocated, including treat-to-cholesterol target, lowest-is-best, and risk-based treatment approaches. However, only 1 approach has been evaluated in multiple RCTs\u2014the use of fixed doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce ASCVD risk. Because the overwhelming body of evidence came from statin RCTs, the Expert Panel appropriately focused on these statin RCTs to develop evidence-based guidelines for the reduction of ASCVD risk. We recognize that this represents a significant departure from current strategies. This should not come as a surprise to clinicians. The recent guideline on heart failure has changed long-standing paradigms on the basis of the evidence, and this guideline does as well.5 Future RCTs will be needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy to provide the greatest reduction in ASCVD events with best margin of safety.The Expert Panel acknowledges that our process did not provide for a comprehensive approach to the detection, evaluation, and treatment of lipid disorders as was done in the prior Adult Treatment Panel III Report.6 However, the present guideline was never intended to be a comprehensive approach to lipid management for purposes other than ASCVD risk reduction. A limited number of expert opinion recommendations were made only when RCT evidence was not present and after a thorough consideration of what the Expert Panel had learned from the RCTs. For the many questions about complex lipid disorders that are beyond the scope of our systematic evidence review, or for which little or no RCT data are available, it is anticipated that clinicians with lipid expertise can contribute to their management.1.4. Methodology and Evidence ReviewAlthough the Expert Panel was convened before the Institute of Medicine reports on practice guidelines, our evidence-based process followed most of the standards from the Institute of Medicine report, \u201cClinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust.\u201d1 The systematic review was limited to RCTs with ASCVD outcomes and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs with ASCVD outcomes. Observational studies and those with <18 months (CQ1 and CQ2) or <12 months (CQ3) of follow-up were excluded. Support was provided by a methodology contractor and a systematic review and general support contractor and included the following steps:The Expert Panel constructed CQs relevant to clinical practice.The Expert Panel identified (a priori) inclusion/exclusion criteria for each CQ.An independent contractor developed a literature search strategy, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, for each CQ.An independent contractor executed a systematic electronic search of the published literature from relevant bibliographic databases for each CQ. The date range for the overall literature search was January 1, 1995, through December 1, 2009. However, RCTs with hard ASCVD outcomes of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular death published after that date range were eligible for consideration until the Expert Panel began deliberations on relevant recommendations.RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were independently graded as fair or good quality were included in the evidence tables for the consideration of the Expert Panel. RCTs that were graded as poor quality were excluded.With the assistance of independent methodologists, this evidence base was used to develop a series of evidence statements graded on the level of the evidence (high, medium, or low).The Expert Panel then synthesized the evidence statements into treatment recommendations/summaries graded as A (strong), B (moderate), C (weak), D (recommend against), E (expert), and N (no recommendation).The final evidence statements and treatment recommendations were approved by at least a majority of voting members of the Expert Panel.Guideline implementability appraisals, planned and coordinated by the NHLBI Implementation Work Group, were performed to identify and address barriers to guideline implementation.In addition, the Expert Panel was able to include major RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs published through July 2013 in our discussion and as part of the process of determining ACC/AHA grading of the NHLBI expert-level recommendations.2. Overview of the GuidelineThe RCTs identified in the systematic evidence review indicated a consistent reduction in ASCVD events from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy in secondary- and primary-prevention populations, with the exception of no ASCVD event reduction when statin therapy was initiated in those with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure or those receiving maintenance hemodialysis. The RCTs either compared fixed doses of statins with placebo or untreated controls, or compared fixed doses of higher-intensity statins with moderate-intensity statins. These trials were not designed to evaluate the effect of titrated (dose-adjusted) statin treatment to achieve prespecified LDL-C or non\u2013HDL-C goals.Therefore, the Expert Panel was unable to find RCT evidence to support titrating cholesterol-lowering drug therapy to achieve target LDL-C or non\u2013HDL-C levels, as recommended by Adult Treatment Panel III.6\u20138 Notably, the Expert Panel did find RCT evidence that use of therapy (eg, niacin) to additionally lower non\u2013HDL-C, once an LDL-C target was achieved, did not further reduce ASCVD outcomes.9 The Expert Panel also found extensive RCT evidence that the appropriate intensity of statin therapy should be used to reduce ASCVD risk in those most likely to benefit. The work of the Expert Panel was informed by the reports of the Lifestyle Management10 and Risk Assessment Work Groups11 (Figure 1). A summary of the major recommendations for the treatment of cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk are provided in Table 3.Table 3.

    "abstract": "We propose a new STAcked and Reconstructed Graph Convolutional Networks (STAR-GCN) architecture to learn node representations for boosting the performance in recommender systems, especially in the cold start scenario. STAR-GCN employs a stack of GCN encoder-decoders combined with intermediate supervision to improve the final prediction performance. Unlike the graph convolutional matrix completion model with one-hot encoding node inputs, our STAR-GCN learns low-dimensional user and item latent factors as the input to restrain the model space complexity. Moreover, our STAR-GCN can produce node embeddings for new nodes by reconstructing masked input node embeddings, which essentially tackles the cold start problem. Furthermore, we discover a label leakage issue when training GCN-based models for link prediction tasks and propose a training strategy to avoid the issue. Empirical results on multiple rating prediction benchmarks demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in four out of five real-world datasets and significant improvements in predicting ratings in the cold start scenario. The code implementation is available in https://github.com/jennyzhang0215/STAR-GCN."

    "title": "An Approach to Integrating Sentiment Analysis into Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been applied in a wide range of domains such as e-commerce, media, banking, and utilities. This kind of system provides personalized suggestions based on large amounts of data to increase user satisfaction. These suggestions help client select products, while organizations can increase the consumption of a product. In the case of social data, sentiment analysis can help gain better understanding of a user\u2019s attitudes, opinions and emotions, which is beneficial to integrate in recommender systems for achieving higher recommendation reliability. On the one hand, this information can be used to complement explicit ratings given to products by users. On the other hand, sentiment analysis of items that can be derived from online news services, blogs, social media or even from the recommender systems themselves is seen as capable of providing better recommendations to users. In this study, we present and evaluate a recommendation approach that integrates sentiment analysis into collaborative filtering methods. The recommender system proposal is based on an adaptive architecture, which includes improved techniques for feature extraction and deep learning models based on sentiment analysis. The results of the empirical study performed with two popular datasets show that sentiment\u2013based deep learning models and collaborative filtering methods can significantly improve the recommender system\u2019s performance."

    "title": "A stage-based model of personal informatics systems",
    "abstract": "People strive to obtain self-knowledge. A class of systems called personal informatics is appearing that help people collect and reflect on personal information. However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value of systems."

    "title": "Product-Based Neural Networks for User Response Prediction over Multi-Field Categorical Data",
    "abstract": "User response prediction is a crucial component for personalized information retrieval and filtering scenarios, such as recommender system and web search. The data in user response prediction is mostly in a multi-field categorical format and transformed into sparse representations via one-hot encoding. Due to the sparsity problems in representation and optimization, most research focuses on feature engineering and shallow modeling. Recently, deep neural networks have attracted research attention on such a problem for their high capacity and end-to-end training scheme. In this article, we study user response prediction in the scenario of click prediction. We first analyze a coupled gradient issue in latent vector-based models and propose kernel product to learn field-aware feature interactions. Then, we discuss an insensitive gradient issue in DNN-based models and propose Product-based Neural Network, which adopts a feature extractor to explore feature interactions. Generalizing the kernel product to a net-in-net architecture, we further propose Product-network in Network (PIN), which can generalize previous models. Extensive experiments on four industrial datasets and one contest dataset demonstrate that our models consistently outperform eight baselines on both area under curve and log loss. Besides, PIN makes great click-through rate improvement (relatively 34.67%) in online A/B test."

    "title": "Geo topic model",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method that analyzes the location log data of multiple users to recommend locations to be visited. The method uses our new topic model, called Geo Topic Model, that can jointly estimate both the user's interests and activity area hosting the user's home, office and other personal places. By explicitly modeling geographical features of locations and users, the user's interests in other features of locations, which we call latent topics, can be inferred effectively. The topic interests estimated by our model 1) lead to high accuracy in predicting visit behavior as driven by personal interests, 2) make possible the generation of recommendations when the user is in an unfamiliar area (e.g. sightseeing), and 3) enable the recommender system to suggest an interpretable representation of the user profile that can be customized by the user. Experiments are conducted using real location logs of landmark and restaurant visits to evaluate the recommendation performance of the proposed method in terms of the accuracy of predicting visit selections. We also show that our model can estimate latent features of locations such as art, nature and atmosphere as latent topics, and describe each user's preference based on them."

    "title": "Modeling Users Preference Dynamics and Side Information in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "In recommender systems user preferences can be fairly dynamic, as users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users."

It investigates whether context specific variables, such as organizational type and contract length, change customer value evaluations and the value \u2013 intention to repurchase \u2013 recommend system. Design/methodology/approach A survey of Australian customers of a research and development service organization was conducted. Structural equation modelling was used to develop a model investigating factors that affect customer value, intent to re\u2010purchase, and word\u2010of\u2010mouth/recommendation. Findings Relationship benefits, service benefits and sacrifice all had a significant influence on customer value. Efficient use of time is crucial for sacrifice evaluation. Relationship benefits were larger for government organizations than private organizations. Importance of value to recommend the organization to others was higher for longer contracts and government customers. Research limitation/implications Results show that R&amp;D organizations need to concentrate on both the technical service/science aspects and the relationship aspects in their contracts. Government institutions tended to emphasize the relationship benefits while private businesses considered service benefits, relationship benefits and sacrifice nearly equal in their determination of value. Intent to contract R&amp;D organization for further work and the willingness to recommend it to others as a highly specialized and competent service provider seem to be higher for government customers and longer contracts. Originality/value This paper investigates customer value in a little researched industry, R&amp;D. The findings are relevant for similar professional business\u2010to\u2010business services."

We present the results of a year-long naturalistic inquiry into application\u2019s usage patterns, based on logging users\u2019 actions. We analyze the data to develop user models, individualized expert models, confidence intervals, and instructional indicators. We show how this information could be used to tutor users. Introduction Recommender Systems typically help people select products, services, and information. A novel application of recommender systems is to help individuals select \u2019what to learn next\u2019 by recommending knowledge that their peers have found useful. For example, people typically utilize only a small portion of a software application\u2019s functionality (one study shows users applying less than 10% of Microsoft Word\u2019s commands). A recommender system can unobtrusively note which portions of an application\u2019s functionality that the members of an organization find useful, group the organization\u2019s members into sets of similar users, or peers (based on similar demographic factors such as job title, or similarities in command usage patterns), and produce recommendations for learning that are specific to the individual in the context of his/her organization, peers, and current activities. This paper reports research on a recommender system (Resnick & Varian, 1997) intended to promote gradual but perpetual performance improvement in the use of application software. We present our rationale, an analysis of a year\u2019s collected data, and a vision of how users might learn from the system. We have worked with one commercial application, and believe our approach is generally applicable. The research explores the potential of a new sort of user modeling based on summaries of logged user data. This method of user modeling enables the observation of a large number of users over a long period of time, enables concurrent development of student models and individualized expert models, and applies recommender system techniques to on-the-job instruction. Earlier work is reported in Linton (1990), and Linton (1996). Kay and Thomas (1995), Thomas (1996) report on related work with a text editor in an academic environment. A recommender system to enhance the organization-wide learning of application software is a means of promoting organizational learning (Senge, 1990). By pooling and sharing expertise, recommender systems augment and assist the natural social process of people learning from each other. This approach is quite distinct from systems, such as Microsoft\u2019s Office Assistant, which recommend new commands based on their logical equivalence to the lessefficient way a user may be performing a task. The system presented here will (1) capture evolving expertise from community of practice (Lave & Wenger 1991), (2) support less-skilled members of the community in acquiring expertise, and (3) serve as an organizational memory for the expertise it captures. In many workplaces ... mastery is in short supply and what is required is a kind of collaborative bootstrapping of expertise. (Eales & Welch, 1995, p. 100) The main goal of the approach taken in this work is to continuously improve the performance of application users by providing individualized modeling and coaching based on the automated comparison of user models to expert models. The system described here would be applicable in any situation where a number of application users perform similar tasks on networked computers 65 From: AAAI Technical Report WS-98-08.

In the remainder of this section we describe the logging process and make some initial remarks about modeling and coaching software users. We then present an analysis of the data we have logged and our process of creating individual models of expertise. In the final section we describe further work and close with a summary. Each time a user issues a Word command such as Cut or Paste, the command is written to the log, together with a time stamp, and then executed. The logger, called OWL for Organization-Wide Learning, comes up when the user opens Word; it creates a separate log for each file the user edits, and when the user quits Word, it sends the logs to a server where they are periodically loaded into a database for analysis. A toolbar button labeled \u2019OWL is ON\u2019 (or OFF) informs users of OWL\u2019s tate and gives them control. Individual models of expertise We have selected the Edit commands for further analysis. A similar analysis could be performed for each type of command. The first of the three tables in Figure 1 presents data on the Edit commands for each of our 16 users. In the table, each column contains data for one user and each row contains data for one command (Edit commands that were not used have been omitted). A cell then, contains the count of the number of times the individual has used the command. The columns have been sorted so that the person using the most commands is on the left and the person using the fewest is on the right. Similarly, the rows have been sorted so that the most frequently used command is in the top row and the least frequently used command is in the bottom row. Consequently the cells with the largest values are in the upper left corner and those with the smallest values are in the lower right comer. The table has been shaded to make the contours of the numbers visible: the largest numbers have the darkest shading and the smallest numbers have no shading, each shade indicates an order of magnitude. Inspection of the first table reveals that users tend to acquire the Edit commands in a specific sequence, i.e., those that know fewer commands know a subset of the commands used by their more-knowledgeable peers. If instead, users acquired commands in an idiosyncratic order, the data would not sort as it does. And if they acquired commands in a manner that strongly reflected their job tasks or their writing tasks, there would be subgroups of users who shared common commands. Also, the more-knowledgeable users do not replace commands learned early on with more powerful commands, but instead keep adding new commands to their repertoire. Finally, the sequence of command acquisition corresponds to the commands\u2019 frequency of use. While this last point is not necessarily a surprise, neither is it a given. There are some peaks and valleys in the data as sorted, and a fairly rough edge where commands transition from being used rarely to being used not at all. These peaks, valleys, and rough edges may represent periods of repetitive tasks or lack of data, respectively, or they may represent overdependence on some command that has a more powerful substitute or ignorance of a command or of a task (a sequence of commands) that uses the command. In other words, some of the peaks, valleys, and rough edges may represent opportunities to learn more effective use of the software. In the second table in Figure 1 the data have been smoothed. The observed value in each cell has been replaced by an expected value, the most likely value for the cell, using a method taken from statistics, based on the row, column and grand totals for the table (Howell, 1982). In the case of software use, the row effect is the overall relative utility of the command (for all users) and the column effect is the usage of related commands by the individual user. The expected value is the usage the command would have if the individual used it in a manner consistent with his/her usage of related commands and consistent with his/her peers\u2019 usage of the command. These expected values are a new kind of expert model, one that is unique to each individual and each moment in time; the expected value in each cell reflects the individual\u2019s use of related commands, and one\u2019s peers\u2019 use of the same command. The reason for differences between observed and expected values, between one\u2019s actual and expert model, might have several explanations such as the individual\u2019s tasks, preferences, experiences, or hardware, but we are most interested when the difference indicates the lack of knowledge or skill."

    "title": "Putting Users in Control of their Recommendations",
    "abstract": "The essence of a recommender system is that it can recommend items personalized to the preferences of an individual user. But typically users are given no explicit control over this personalization, and are instead left guessing about how their actions affect the resulting recommendations. We hypothesize that any recommender algorithm will better fit some users' expectations than others, leaving opportunities for improvement. To address this challenge, we study a recommender that puts some control in the hands of users. Specifically, we build and evaluate a system that incorporates user-tuned popularity and recency modifiers, allowing users to express concepts like \"show more popular items\". We find that users who are given these controls evaluate the resulting recommendations much more positively. Further, we find that users diverge in their preferred settings, confirming the importance of giving control to users."

    "title": "Unified Conversational Recommendation Policy Learning via Graph-based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable the traditional recommender systems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes through interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely adopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at each conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated conversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In the light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to systematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop a dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action at each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items. Further, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action selection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the preference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances the scalability and stability of CRS."

    "title": "Gaze Prediction for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "As users browse a recommender system, they systematically consider or skip over much of the displayed content. It seems obvious that these eye gaze patterns contain a rich signal concerning these users' preferences. However, because eye tracking data is not available to most recommender systems, these signals are not widely incorporated into personalization models. In this work, we show that it is possible to predict gaze by combining easily-collected user browsing data with eye tracking data from a small number of users in a grid-based recommender interface. Our technique is able to leverage a small amount of eye tracking data to infer gaze patterns for other users. We evaluate our prediction models in MovieLens -- an online movie recommender system. Our results show that incorporating eye tracking data from a small number of users significantly boosts accuracy as compared with only using browsing data, even though the eye-tracked users are different from the testing users (e.g. AUC=0.823 vs. 0.693 in predicting whether a user will fixate on an item). We also demonstrate that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be applied in this setting; they are better than linear models in predicting fixation probability and capturing the interface regularity through Bayesian inference (AUC=0.823 vs. 0.757)."

    "title": "Item Silk Road: Recommending Items from Information Domains to Social Users",
    "abstract": "Online platforms can be divided into information-oriented and social-oriented domains. The former refers to forums or E-commerce sites that emphasize user-item interactions, like Trip.com and Amazon; whereas the latter refers to social networking services (SNSs) that have rich user-user connections, such as Facebook and Twitter. Despite their heterogeneity, these two domains can be bridged by a few overlapping users, dubbed as bridge users. In this work, we address the problem of cross-domain social recommendation, i.e., recommending relevant items of information domains to potential users of social networks. To our knowledge, this is a new problem that has rarely been studied before. Existing cross-domain recommender systems are unsuitable for this task since they have either focused on homogeneous information domains or assumed that users are fully overlapped. Towards this end, we present a novel Neural Social Collaborative Ranking (NSCR) approach, which seamlessly sews up the user-item interactions in information domains and user-user connections in SNSs. In the information domain part, the attributes of users and items are leveraged to strengthen the embedding learning of users and items. In the SNS part, the embeddings of bridge users are propagated to learn the embeddings of other non-bridge users. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our NSCR method."

    "title": "A Random Walk around the City: New Venue Recommendation in Location-Based Social Networks",
    "abstract": "The popularity of location-based social networks available on mobile devices means that large, rich datasets that contain a mixture of behavioral (users visiting venues), social (links between users), and spatial (distances between venues) information are available for mobile location recommendation systems. However, these datasets greatly differ from those used in other online recommender systems, where users explicitly rate items: it remains unclear as to how they capture user preferences as well as how they can be leveraged for accurate recommendation. This paper seeks to bridge this gap with a three-fold contribution. First, we examine how venue discovery behavior characterizes the large check-in datasets from two different location-based social services, Foursquare and Go Walla: by using large-scale datasets containing both user check-ins and social ties, our analysis reveals that, across 11 cities, between 60% and 80% of users' visits are in venues that were not visited in the previous 30 days. We then show that, by making constraining assumptions about user mobility, state-of-the-art filtering algorithms, including latent space models, do not produce high quality recommendations. Finally, we propose a new model based on personalized random walks over a user-place graph that, by seamlessly combining social network and venue visit frequency data, obtains between 5 and 18% improvement over other models. Our results pave the way to a new approach for place recommendation in location-based social systems."

Usually, the choice of the similarity measure used for evaluation of neighborhood relationships is crucial for the success of such approaches. In this article we propose a way to calculate similarities by formulating a regression problem which enables us to extract the similarities from the data in a problem-specific way. Another popular approach for recommender systems is regularized matrix factorization (RMF). We present an algorithm -- neighborhood-aware matrix factorization -- which efficiently includes neighborhood information in a RMF model. This leads to increased prediction accuracy. The proposed methods are tested on the Netflix dataset."

This paper is an investigation of using collaborative filtering techniques for a music recommender system. Collaborative filtering is the technology that focuses on the relationships between users and between items to make a prediction. The goal of the recommender system is to compute a scoring function that aggregates the result of computing similarities between users and between items. We focus on the reviewing two strategies of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based recommendations. For experimental purpose we explore different metrics to measure the similarity of users and items such as Euclidean distance, cosine metric, Pearson correlation and others. Finally, we compare different evaluations metrics that represent the effectiveness of the recommender system."

    "title": "PipAttack: Poisoning Federated Recommender Systems for Manipulating Item Promotion",
    "abstract": "Due to the growing privacy concerns, decentralization emerges rapidly in personalized services, especially recommendation. Also, recent studies have shown that centralized models are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, compromising their integrity. In the context of recommender systems, a typical goal of such poisoning attacks is to promote the adversary's target items by interfering with the training dataset and/or process. Hence, a common practice is to subsume recommender systems under the decentralized federated learning paradigm, which enables all user devices to collaboratively learn a global recommender while retaining all the sensitive data locally. Without exposing the full knowledge of the recommender and entire dataset to end-users, such federated recommendation is widely regarded 'safe' towards poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to backdooring federated recommender systems for targeted item promotion. The core tactic is to take advantage of the inherent popularity bias that commonly exists in data-driven recommenders. As popular items are more likely to appear in the recommendation list, our innovatively designed attack model enables the target item to have the characteristics of popular items in the embedding space. Then, by uploading carefully crafted gradients via a small number of malicious users during the model update, we can effectively increase the exposure rate of a target (unpopular) item in the resulted federated recommender. Evaluations on two real-world datasets show that 1) our attack model significantly boosts the exposure rate of the target item in a stealthy way, without harming the accuracy of the poisoned recommender; and 2) existing defenses are not effective enough, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local model poisoning attacks to federated recommender systems."

The approach suggests the introduction of a time-based forgetting function, which makes the last observations more significant for the learning algorithms than the old ones. The importance of examples decreases with time. Namely, the forgetting function provides each training example with a weight, according its appearance over time. The used learning algorithms are modified to be able to deal with weighted examples. Experiments are conducted with the STAGGER problem using NBC and ID3 algorithms. The results provide evidences that the utilization of gradual forgetting is able to improve the predictive accuracy on drifting concepts. The method was also implemented for a recommender system, which learns about user from observations. The results from experiments with this application show that the method is able to improve the system\u2019s adaptability to drifting user\u2019s interest."

    "title": "Optimizing multiple objectives in collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "This paper is about the utility of making personalized recommendations. While it is important to accurately predict the target user's preference, in practice the accuracy should not be the only concern; a useful recommender system needs to consider the user's utility or satisfaction of fulfilling a certain information seeking task. For example, recommending popular items (products) is unlikely to result in more gain than discovering insignificant (\"long tail\") yet liked items because the popular ones might be already known to the user. Equally, recommending items that are out of stock would be frustrating for both the user and system if the system is employed to discover items to purchase. Thus, it is important to have a flexible recommendation framework that takes into account additional recommendation goals meanwhile minimizing the performance loss in order to provide greater adjustability and a better user experience."

    "abstract": "It is of great importance for researchers to publish research results in high-quality journals. However, it is often challenging to choose the most suitable publication venue, given the exponential growth of journals and conferences. Although recommender systems have achieved success in promoting movies, music, and products, very few studies have explored recommendation of publication venues, especially for biomedical research. No recommender system exists that can specifically recommend journals in PubMed, the largest collection of biomedical literature.We aimed to propose a publication recommender system, named Pubmender, to suggest suitable PubMed journals based on a paper's abstract.In Pubmender, pretrained word2vec was first used to construct the start-up feature space. Subsequently, a deep convolutional neural network was constructed to achieve a high-level representation of abstracts, and a fully connected softmax model was adopted to recommend the best journals.We collected 880,165 papers from 1130 journals in PubMed Central and extracted abstracts from these papers as an empirical dataset. We compared different recommendation models such as Cavnar-Trenkle on the Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) engine, a collaborative filtering-based recommender system for the digital library of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and CiteSeer. We found the accuracy of our system for the top 10 recommendations to be 87.0%, 22.9%, and 196.0% higher than that of MAS, ACM, and CiteSeer, respectively. In addition, we compared our system with Journal Finder and Journal Suggester, which are tools of Elsevier and Springer, respectively, that help authors find suitable journals in their series. The results revealed that the accuracy of our system was 329% higher than that of Journal Finder and 406% higher than that of Journal Suggester for the top 10 recommendations.

    "abstract": "Music recommender systems have become a key technology to support the interaction of users with the increasingly larger music catalogs of on-line music streaming services, on-line music shops, and personal devices. An important task in music recommender systems is the automated continuation of music playlists, that enables the recommendation of music streams adapting to given (possibly short) listening sessions. Previous works have shown that applying collaborative filtering to collections of curated music playlists reveals underlying playlist-song co-occurrence patterns that are useful to predict playlist continuations. However, most music collections exhibit a pronounced long-tailed distribution. The majority of songs occur only in few playlists and, as a consequence, they are poorly represented by collaborative filtering. We introduce two feature-combination hybrid recommender systems that extend collaborative filtering by integrating the collaborative information encoded in curated music playlists with any type of song feature vector representation. We conduct off-line experiments to assess the performance of the proposed systems to recover withheld playlist continuations, and we compare them to competitive pure and hybrid collaborative filtering baselines. The results of the experiments indicate that the introduced feature-combination hybrid recommender systems can more accurately predict fitting playlist continuations as a result of their improved representation of songs occurring in few playlists."

The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets. To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations based on these relationships. In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways to evaluate efficiency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of recommender systems."

On the one hand one has to overcome `standard' recommender systems challenges, such as dealing with large, sparse, and long-tailed datasets. On the other, several new challenges present themselves, such as the need to model content in terms of its visual appearance, or even social dynamics, such as a preference toward a particular artist that is independent of the art they create. In this paper we build large-scale recommender systems to model the dynamics of a vibrant digital art community, Behance, consisting of tens of millions of interactions (clicks and 'appreciates') of users toward digital art. Methodologically, our main contributions are to model (a) rich content, especially in terms of its visual appearance; (b) temporal dynamics, in terms of how users prefer 'visually consistent' content within and across sessions; and (c) social dynamics, in terms of how users exhibit preferences both towards certain art styles, as well as the artists themselves."

Once the features has been identified, it is shown their impact in different performance aspects of the system. This approach was applied to a semantic based restaurant recommender system. Results show that feature selection techniques can be applied successfully to identify relevant contextual data.

    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by malicious users who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, malicious shilling user profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system which can significantly affect the robustness of a recommender system. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of shilling profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. The aim of this work is to explore simpler unsupervised alternatives which exploit the nature of shilling profiles, and can be easily plugged into collaborative filtering framework to add robustness. Two statistical methods are developed and experimentally shown to provide high accuracy in shilling attack detection."

In this article, we outline some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in using deep learning for recommender systems at Netflix. We first provide an overview of the various recommendation tasks on the Netflix service. We found that different model architectures excel at different tasks. Even though many deep\u2010learning models can be understood as extensions of existing (simple) recommendation algorithms, we initially did not observe significant improvements in performance over well\u2010tuned non\u2010deep\u2010learning approaches. Only when we added numerous features of heterogeneous types to the input data, deep\u2010learning models did start to shine in our setting. We also observed that deep\u2010learning methods can exacerbate the problem of offline\u2013online metric (mis\u2010)alignment. After addressing these challenges, deep learning has ultimately resulted in large improvements to our recommendations as measured by both offline and online metrics. On the practical side, integrating deep\u2010learning toolboxes in our system has made it faster and easier to implement and experiment with both deep\u2010learning and non\u2010deep\u2010learning approaches for various recommendation tasks. We conclude this article by summarizing our take\u2010aways that may generalize to other applications beyond Netflix."

    "title": "Systematic review: YouTube recommendations and problematic content",
    "abstract": "There has been much concern that social media, in particular YouTube, may facilitate radicalisation and polarisation of online audiences. This systematic review aimed to determine whether the YouTube recommender system facilitates pathways to problematic content such as extremist or radicalising material. The review conducted a narrative synthesis of the papers in this area. It assessed the eligibility of 1,187 studies and excluded studies using the PRISMA process for systematic reviews, leaving a final sample of 23 studies. Overall, 14 studies implicated the YouTube recommender system in facilitating problematic content pathways, seven produced mixed results, and two did not implicate the recommender system. The review's findings indicate that the YouTube recommender system could lead users to problematic content. However, due to limited access and an incomplete understanding of the YouTube recommender system, the models built by researchers might not reflect the actual mechanisms underlying the YouTube recommender system and pathways to problematic content."

    "title": "Enriching user profiling with affective features for the improvement of a multimodal recommender system",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been systematically applied in industry and academia to help users cope with information uncertainty. However, given the multiplicity of the preferences and needs it has been shown that no approach is suitable for all users in all situations. Thus, it is believed that an effective recommender system should incorporate a variety of techniques and features to offer valuable recommendations and enhance the search experience. In this paper we propose a novel video search interface that employs a multimodal recommender system, which can predict topical relevance. The multimodal recommender accounts for interaction data, contextual information, as well as users' affective responses, and exploits these information channels to provide meaningful recommendations of unseen videos. Our experiment shows that the multimodal interaction feature is a promising way to improve the performance of recommendation."

    "abstract": "In recent years, recommender systems (RS) provide a considerable progress to users. RSs reduce the cost of a user\u2019s time in order to reach to desired results faster. The main issue of RSs is the presence of cold users which are less active and their preferences are more difficult to detect. The aim of this study is to provide a new way to improve recall and precision in recommender systems for cold users. According to the available categories of items, prioritization of the proposed items is improved and then presented to the cold user. The obtained results show that in addition to increased speed of processing, recall and precision have an acceptable improvement."

    "abstract": "Latent factor analysis (LFA) via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is highly efficient in discovering user and item patterns from high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices from recommender systems. However, most LFA-based recommender systems adopt a standard SGD algorithm, which suffers limited scalability when addressing big data. On the other hand, most existing parallel SGD solvers are either under the memory-sharing framework designed for a bare machine or suffering high communicational costs, which also greatly limits their applications in large-scale systems. To address the above issues, this article proposes a distributed alternative stochastic gradient descent (DASGD) solver for an LFA-based recommender. Its training-dependences among latent features are decoupled via alternatively fixing one-half of the features to learn the other half following the principle of SGD but in parallel. It's distribution mechanism consists of efficient data partition, allocation and task parallelization strategies, which greatly reduces its communicational cost for high scalability. Experimental results on three large-scale HiDS matrices generated by real-world applications demonstrate that the proposed DASGD algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art distributed SGD solvers for recommender systems in terms of prediction accuracy as well as scalability. Hence, it is highly useful for training LFA-based recommenders on large scale HiDS matrices with the help of cloud computing facilities."

But tensors may achieve improved recommendation quality while worsening the fairness of the recommendations. Hence, we propose a novel fairness-aware tensor recommendation framework that is designed to maintain quality while dramatically improving fairness. Four key aspects of the proposed framework are: (i) a new sensitive latent factor matrix for isolating sensitive features; (ii) a sensitive information regularizer that extracts sensitive information which can taint other latent factors; (iii) an effective algorithm to solve the proposed optimization model; and (iv) extension to multi-feature and multi-category cases which previous efforts have not addressed. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the framework enhances recommendation fairness while preserving recommendation quality in comparison with state-of-the-art alternatives."

A modified Delphi method was used to develop consensus definitions and classifications, and build on the existing framework of the International Classification of Diseases-10 and DSM-IV: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association, which were limited to consideration of psychiatric disorders.Classifications were expanded to include psychogenic and organic causes of desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain disorders. An essential element of the new diagnostic system is the \"personal distress\" criterion. In particular, new definitions of sexual arousal and hypoactive sexual desire disorders were developed, and a new category of noncoital sexual pain disorder was added. In addition, a new subtyping system for clinical diagnosis was devised. Guidelines for clinical end points and outcomes were proposed, and important research goals and priorities were identified.We recommend use of the new female sexual dysfunction diagnostic and classification system based on physiological as well as psychological pathophysiologies, and a personal distress criterion for most diagnostic categories."

    "title": "Active learning strategies for rating elicitation in collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "The accuracy of collaborative-filtering recommender systems largely depends on three factors: the quality of the rating prediction algorithm, and the quantity and quality of available ratings. While research in the field of recommender systems often concentrates on improving prediction algorithms, even the best algorithms will fail if they are fed poor-quality data during training, that is, garbage in, garbage out. Active learning aims to remedy this problem by focusing on obtaining better-quality data that more aptly reflects a user's preferences. However, traditional evaluation of active learning strategies has two major flaws, which have significant negative ramifications on accurately evaluating the system's performance (prediction error, precision, and quantity of elicited ratings). (1) Performance has been evaluated for each user independently (ignoring system-wide improvements). (2) Active learning strategies have been evaluated in isolation from unsolicited user ratings (natural acquisition). In this article we show that an elicited rating has effects across the system, so a typical user-centric evaluation which ignores any changes of rating prediction of other users also ignores these cumulative effects, which may be more influential on the performance of the system as a whole (system centric). We propose a new evaluation methodology and use it to evaluate some novel and state-of-the-art rating elicitation strategies. We found that the system-wide effectiveness of a rating elicitation strategy depends on the stage of the rating elicitation process, and on the evaluation measures (MAE, NDCG, and Precision). In particular, we show that using some common user-centric strategies may actually degrade the overall performance of a system. Finally, we show that the performance of many common active learning strategies changes significantly when evaluated concurrently with the natural acquisition of ratings in recommender systems."

    "title": "A Deep Latent Factor Model for High-Dimensional and Sparse Matrices in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) commonly adopt a user-item rating matrix to describe users' preferences on items. With users and items exploding, such a matrix is usually high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS). Recently, the idea of deep learning has been applied to RSs. However, current deep-structured RSs suffer from high computational complexity. Enlightened by the idea of deep forest, this paper proposes a deep latent factor model (DLFM) for building a deep-structured RS on an HiDS matrix efficiently. Its main idea is to construct a deep-structured model by sequentially connecting multiple latent factor (LF) models instead of multilayered neural networks through a nonlinear activation function. Thus, the computational complexity grows linearly with its layer count, which is easy to resolve in practice. The experimental results on four HiDS matrices from industrial RSs demonstrate that when compared with state-of-the-art LF models and deep-structured RSs, DLFM can well balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, which well fits the desire of industrial RSs for fast and right recommendations."

This study proposes a hybrid, trust-based recommender system to mitigate above learning issues in online CoPs. A case study was conducted using Stack Overflow data to test the recommender system. Important findings include: (1) comparing with other social community platforms, learners in online CoPs have stronger social relations and tend to interact with a smaller group of people only; (2) the hybrid algorithm can provide more accurate recommendations than celebrity-based and content-based algorithm and; (3) the proposed recommender system can facilitate the formation of personalized learning communities."

We introduce a novel and fast (semi)-positive MF approach that approximates the features by using positive values for either users or items. We describe a momentum-based MF approach. A transductive version of MF is also introduced, which uses information from test instances (namely the ratings users have given for certain items) to improve prediction accuracy. We describe an incremental variant of MF that efficiently handles new users/ratings, which is crucial in a real-life recommender system. A hybrid MF--neighbor-based method is also discussed that further improves the performance of MF. The proposed methods are evaluated on the Netflix Prize dataset, and we show that they can achieve very favorable Quiz RMSE (best single method: 0.8904, combination: 0.8841) and running time."

    "abstract": "Natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and more mundane risks can seriously disrupt or delay the flow of material, information and cash through an organization's supply chain. The authors assert that how well a company fares against such threats will depend on its level of preparedness, and the type of disruption. Each supply-chain risk to forecasts, information systems, intellectual property, procurement, inventory and capacity has its own drivers and effective mitigation strategies. To avoid lost sales, increased costs or both, managers need to tailor proven risk-reduction strategies to their organizations. \n\nManaging supply-chain risk is difficult, however. Dell, Toyota, Motorola and other leading manufacturers excel at identifying and neutralizing supply-chain risks through a delicate balancing act: keeping inventory, capacity and related elements at appropriate levels across the entire supply chain in a rapidly changing environment. Organizations can prepare for or avoid delays by smart sizing their capacity and inventory. The manager serves as a kind of financial portfolio manager, seeking to achieve the highest achievable profits (reward) for varying levels of supply-chain risk. \n\nThe authors recommend a powerful what if? team exercise called stress testing to identify potentially weak links in the supply chain. Armed with this shared understanding, companies can then select the best mitigation strategy: holding reserves, pooling inventory, using redundant suppliers, balancing capacity and inventory, implementing robust backup and recovery systems, adjusting pricing and incentives, bringing or keeping production in-house, and using Continuous Replenishment Programs (CRP), Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) and other supply-chain initiatives."

Nevertheless, recommender systems can be a solution to the problem. However, recommendation systems haven't been sufficiently used in e-learning, in comparison with other fields (i.e. commerce, medicine and so on). In this paper, we propose a semantic recommender system for e-learning by means of which, learners will be able to find and choose the right learning materials suitable to their field of interest. The proposed web based recommendation system comprises ontology and web ontology language (OWL) rules. Rule filtering will be used as recommendation technique. Our proposed recommendation system architecture consists of two subsystems; Semantic Based System and Rule Based System. Modules for either subsystem are; Observer, Learner profile, Recommendation storage and User interface."

We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more appropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the initial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models. We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based Recommender system."

We define a recommender system to be (n, c)-robust if an attacker with n sybil identities cannot cause more than a limited amount c units of damage to predictions.

Among these related categories, products with high behavioral relevance and content relevance are recommended to the user. In addition, our algorithm considers the temporal factor, i.e., the purchase time of the active product and the recommendation time.

Because of the multitude of relationships existing in recommender systems, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based approaches have been proposed to better characterize the various relationships between a user and items while modeling a user's preferences. Previous graph-based recommendation approaches process the observed user-item interaction graph as a ground-truth depiction of the relationships between users and items. However, especially in the implicit recommendation setting, all the unobserved user-item interactions are usually assumed to be negative samples. There are missing links that represent a user's future actions. In addition, there may be spurious or misleading positive interactions. To alleviate the above issue, in this work, we take a first step to introduce a principled way to model the uncertainty in the user-item interaction graph using the Bayesian Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework. We discuss how inference can be performed under our framework and provide a concrete formulation using the Bayesian Probabilistic Ranking training loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on four benchmark recommendation datasets. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based recommendation models. Furthermore, we conducted an offline evaluation on one industrial large-scale dataset. It shows that our proposed method outperforms the baselines, with the potential gain being more significant for cold-start users. This illustrates the potential practical benefit in real-world recommender systems."

    "abstract": "Number of people who uses internet and websites for various purposes is increasing at an astonishing rate. More and more people rely on online sites for purchasing rented movies, songs, apparels, books etc. The competition between numbers of sites forced the web site owners to provide personalized services to their customers. So the recommender systems came into existence. Recommender systems are active information filtering systems and that attempt to present to the user, information items in which the user is interested in. The websites implement recommender systems using collaborative filtering, content based or hybrid approaches. The recommender systems also suffer from issues like cold start, sparsity and over specialization. Cold start problem is that the recommenders cannot draw inferences for users or items for which it does not have sufficient information. This paper attempts to propose a solution to the cold start problem by combining association rules and clustering technique."

    "title": "A social network-based recommender system",
    "abstract": "For more than a decade, recommender systems have been proposed as a key tool to overcome information overload, and many algorithms and systems have been developed. Despite all these efforts, recommender systems still face many challenges\u2014such as improving prediction accuracy, data sparsity, and cold-start issues. On the other hand, the recent emergence of online social networks provides us with an unprecedented large amount of information regarding user behavior and friend interactions. Especially, homophily effects among friends have demonstrated their importance to product marketing, and marketing strategies that utilize homophily have achieved great success. However, such information has not yet been considered in recommender systems. \r\nIn this dissertation we propose a new paradigm of recommender systems which can significantly improve performance by utilizing information in social networks. In particular, we address the following challenging issues in building a social network-based recommender system. 1) We investigate the existence of homophily among friends in rating items using statistical analyses on a dataset crawled from a real online social network, Yelp.com. 2) To understand the role of social relationships in a social network-based recommender system, we develop a Bayesian network-based recommender system (SNRS-BN) based on a simplified homogeneous social network, and study the performance of SNRS-BN under different types of social relationships. 3) We develop a social network-based recommender system (SNRS) which utilizes more information in social network, including user preferences, an item's likability, and homophily effects among friends, to provide better recommendations. An iterative classification has been adopted in this system to incorporate homophily even from friends at multiple hops away. The performance improvements of SNRS are validated through experiments on the Yelp dataset in terms of both prediction accuracy and coverage over traditional recommender systems. 4) To overcome the problems of heterogeneities in social networks, we propose to select relevant friends for inference based on the semantics in fine-grained user ratings on their buying decisions. An experiment is carried out in a graduate student class to validate performance improvements from such semantic filtering. 5) We discuss the trust issues caused by malicious users and users with unreliable domain knowledge in SNRS. In particular, for the case of users with unreliable domain knowledge, we propose to estimate homophily more robustly by relaxing the item category information according to item taxonomy. Future work in this direction will be desirable."

We developed an adaptive assistant: TV3P (TV program personalization for PDR), which observes users' viewing behaviors in the background, updates users' profiles continuously arid autonomously, and then filters and recommends programs for different users according to their respective preference information. The novel aspect of this system is the evaluation of how much time and effort it takes the system to learn new preferences once it already is biased by old preferences. This has not been proposed in any other recommender systems before. It was also proved to match real world users whose preferences can change over time. Another attractive aspect of TV3P is it's employing an implicit and explicit profiling scheme."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to live up to its promise of delivering real value, driven by recent advances in the availability of relevant data, computation and algorithms. In the present paper, I discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more immediate applications will be to improve precision information about what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data. Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making. There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change."

Weak , very low quality of evidence (References 5\u201324 are referred to in the Methodology section which can be accessed at Supplemental Digital Content: Methodology.) SCREENING AND EARLY TREATMENT Screening for Patients With Sepsis and Septic Shock - Recommendation 1. For hospitals and health systems, we recommend using a performance improvement program for sepsis, including sepsis screening for acutely ill, high-risk patients and standard operating procedures for treatment. Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening. Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence for standard operating procedures. Rationale Sepsis performance improvement programs generally consist of sepsis screening, education, measurement of sepsis bundle performance, patient outcomes, and actions for identified opportunities (25,26). Despite some inconsistency, a meta-analysis of 50 observational studies on the effect of performance improvement programs showed that these programs were associated with better adherence to sepsis bundles along with a reduction in mortality (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61\u20130.72) in patients with sepsis and septic shock (27). The specific components of performance improvement did not appear to be as important as the presence of a program that included sepsis screening and metrics. Sepsis screening tools are designed to promote early identification of sepsis and consist of manual methods or automated use of the electronic health record (EHR). There is wide variation in diagnostic accuracy of these tools with most having poor predictive values, although the use of some was associated with improvements in care processes (28\u201331). A variety of clinical variables and tools are used for sepsis screening, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, vital signs, signs of infection, quick Sequential Organ Failure Score (qSOFA) or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) criteria, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (26,32). Machine learning may improve performance of screening tools, and in a meta-analysis of 42,623 patients from seven studies for predicting hospital acquired sepsis the pooled area under the receiving operating curve (SAUROC) (0.89; 95% CI, 0.86\u22120.92); sensitivity (81%; 95% CI, 80\u221281), and specificity (72%; 95% CI, 72\u221272) was higher for machine learning than the SAUROC for traditional screening tools such as SIRS (0.70), MEWS (0.50), and SOFA (0.78) (32). Screening tools may target patients in various locations, such as in-patient wards, emergency departments, or ICUs (28\u201330,32). A pooled analysis of three RCTs did not demonstrate a mortality benefit of active screening (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.51\u22121.58) (33\u201335). However, while there is wide variation in sensitivity and specificity of sepsis screening tools, they are an important component of identifying sepsis early for timely intervention. Standard operating procedures are a set of practices that specify a preferred response to specific clinical circumstances (36). Sepsis standard operating procedures, initially specified as Early Goal Directed Therapy have evolved to \"usual care\" which includes a standard approach with components of the sepsis bundle, early identification, lactate, cultures, antibiotics, and fluids (37). A large study examined the association between implementation of state-mandated sepsis protocols, compliance, and mortality. A retrospective cohort study of 1,012,410 sepsis admissions to 509 hospitals in the United States in a retrospective cohort examined mortality before (27 months) and after (30 months) implementation of New York state sepsis regulations, with a concurrent control population from four other states (38). In this comparative interrupted time series, mortality was lower in hospitals with higher compliance with achieving the sepsis bundles successfully. Lower resource countries may experience a different effect. A meta-analysis of two RCTs in Sub-Saharan Africa found higher mortality (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00\u22121.58) with standard operating procedures compared with usual care, while it was decreased in one observational study (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]; 95% CI, 0.55\u22120.98) (39). - Recommendation 2. We recommend against using qSOFA compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single screening tool for sepsis or septic shock. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Rationale The qSOFA uses three variables to predict death and prolonged ICU stay in patients with known or suspected sepsis: a Glasgow Coma Score < 15, a respiratory rate \u2265 22 breaths/min and a systolic blood pressure \u2264 100 mm Hg. When any two of these variables are present simultaneously, the patient is considered qSOFA positive. Data analysis used to support the recommendations of the Third International Consensus Conference on the Definitions of Sepsis identified qSOFA as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with known or suspected infection, but no analysis was performed to support its use as a screening tool (5). Since that time numerous studies have investigated the potential use of the qSOFA as a screening tool for sepsis (40\u201342). The results have been contradictory as to its usefulness. Studies have shown that qSOFA is more specific but less sensitive than having two of four SIRS criteria for early identification of infection induced organ dysfunction (40\u201343). Neither SIRS nor qSOFA are ideal screening tools for sepsis and the bedside clinician needs to understand the limitations of each. In the original derivation study, authors found that only 24% of infected patients had a qSOFA score 2 or 3, but these patients accounted for 70% of poor outcomes (5). Similar findings have also been found when comparing against the National Early warning Score (NEWS) and the Modified Early warning Score (MEWS) (44). Although the presence of a positive qSOFA should alert the clinician to the possibility of sepsis in all resource settings; given the poor sensitivity of the qSOFA, the panel issued a strong recommendation against its use as a single screening tool. -"

    "title": "Exploiting Music Play Sequence for Music Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Users leave digital footprints when interacting with various music streaming services. Music play sequence, which contains rich information about personal music preference and song similarity, has been largely ignored in previous music recommender systems. In this paper, we explore the effects of music play sequence on developing effective personalized music recommender systems. Towards the goal, we propose to use word embedding techniques in music play sequences to estimate the similarity between songs. The learned similarity is then embedded into matrix factorization to boost the latent feature learning and discovery. Furthermore, the proposed method only considers the k-nearest songs (e.g., k = 5) in the learning process and thus avoids the increase of time complexity. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our methods could significantly improve the performance of both rating prediction and top-n recommendation tasks."

    "title": "Infections in patients with diabetes mellitus: A review of pathogenesis",
    "abstract": "In general, infectious diseases are more frequent and/or serious in patients with diabetes mellitus, which potentially increases their morbimortality. The greater frequency of infections in diabetic patients is caused by the hyperglycemic environment that favors immune dysfunction (e.g., damage to the neutrophil function, depression of the antioxidant system, and humoral immunity), micro- and macro-angiopathies, neuropathy, decrease in the antibacterial activity of urine, gastrointestinal and urinary dysmotility, and greater number of medical interventions in these patients. The infections affect all organs and systems. Some of these problems are seen mostly in diabetic people, such as foot infections, malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, and gangrenous cholecystitis. In addition to the increased morbidity, infectious processes may be the first manifestation of diabetes mellitus or the precipitating factors for complications inherent to the disease, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. Immunization with anti-pneumococcal and influenza vaccines is recommended to reduce hospitalizations, deaths, and medical expenses."

    "title": "Escaping the McNamara Fallacy: Toward More Impactful Recommender Systems Research",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are among today's most successful application areas of artificial intelligence. However, in the recommender systems research community, we have fallen prey to a McNamara fallacy to a worrying extent: In the majority of our research efforts, we rely almost exclusively on computational measures such as prediction accuracy, which are easier to make than applying other evaluation methods. However, it remains unclear whether small improvements in terms of such computational measures matter greatly and whether they lead us to better systems in practice. A paradigm shift in terms of our research culture and goals is therefore needed. We can no longer focus exclusively on abstract computational measures but must direct our attention to research questions that are more relevant and have more impact in the real world. In this work, we review the various ways of how recommender systems may create value; how they, positively or negatively, impact consumers, businesses, and the society; and how we can measure the resulting effects. Through our analyses, we identify a number of research gaps and propose ways of broadening and improving our methodology in a way that leads us to more impactful research in our field."

    "abstract": "The Netflix Prize put the spotlight on the use of data mining and machine learning methods for predicting user preferences. Many lessons came out of the competition. But since then, Recommender Systems have evolved. This evolution has been driven by the greater availability of different kinds of user data in industry and the interest that the area has drawn among the research community. The goal of this paper is to give an up-to-date overview of the use of data mining approaches for personalization and recommendation. Using Netflix personalization as a motivating use case, I will describe the use of different kinds of data and machine learning techniques. After introducing the traditional approaches to recommendation, I highlight some of the main lessons learned from the Netflix Prize. I then describe the use of recommendation and personalization techniques at Netflix. Finally, I pinpoint the most promising current research avenues and unsolved problems that deserve attention in this domain."

    "title": "Using a trust network to improve top-N recommendation",
    "abstract": "Top-N item recommendation is one of the important tasks of recommenders. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems which can predict ratings for a given user and item. Collaborative filtering can be extended for top-N recommendation, but this approach does not work accurately for cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In this paper we propose novel methods exploiting a trust network to improve the quality of top-N recommendation. The first method performs a random walk on the trust network, considering the similarity of users in its termination condition. The second method combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach. Our experimental evaluation on the Epinions dataset demonstrates that approaches using a trust network clearly outperform the collaborative filtering approach in terms of recall, in particular for cold start users."

    "title": "Exploiting contextual information in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender Systems help an on-line user to tame information overload and are being used now in complex domains where it could be beneficial to exploit context-awareness, e.g., in travel recommendation. Technically, in Recommender Systems we can interpret context as a set of constraints or preferences over the usage of items determined by the contextual conditions (e.g., today it is raining or the user is in a particular location). In fact, there is a lack of approaches to deal effectively with contextual data. This thesis investigates some approaches to exploit context in Recommender Systems. It provides a general architecture of context-aware Recommender Systems and analyzes separate components of this model. The main focus is to investigate new approaches that can bring a real added value to users. In this paper I also describe my initial results on item selection and item weighting for context-dependent Collaborative Filtering (CF). Moreover, I shall present my ongoing research on CF hybridization using context."

Combining ideas and techniques from information filtering, user modeling, artificial intelligence, user interface design and human-computer interaction, recommender systems provide users with proactive suggestions that are tailored to meet their particular information needs and preferences. Indeed recommender systems have enjoyed considerable commercial success and continue to play an increasingly important role in many online services, from Amazon and Yahoo! to iTunes and Last.fm. It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second ACM International Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), which builds on a wonderful legacy of research workshops, the Recommenders Summer School held in Bilbao in 2006, and the First ACM International Conference on Recommender Systems held in Minneapolis in 2007. This conference brings together leaders in the field, from both research and practice, to explore the latest innovations, challenges, and opportunities for recommender systems technologies. The call for papers attracted 121 submissions, a more than 100% increase compared to 2007, with authors from nearly 30 different countries.

    "title": "A Hybrid Multi-criteria Semantic-Enhanced Collaborative Filtering Approach for Personalized Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to assist web users to find only relevant information to their needs rather than an undifferentiated mass of information. Collaborative filtering (CF) techniques are probably the most popular and widely adopted techniques in recommender systems. Despite of their success in various applications, CF-based techniques still encounter two major limitations, namely sparsity and cold-start problems. More recently, semantic information of items has been successfully used in recommender systems to alleviate such problems. Moreover, the incorporation of multi-criteria ratings in recommender systems can help to produce more accurate recommendations. Thereby, in this paper, we propose a hybrid Multi-Criteria Semantic-enhanced CF (MC-SeCF) approach. The MC-SeCF approach integrates the enhanced MC item-based CF and the item-based semantic filtering approaches to alleviate current limitations of the item-based CF techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MC-SeCF approach in terms of improving accuracy, as well as in dealing with very sparse data sets or cold-start items compared to benchmark item-based CF techniques."

    "title": "ENGINEERING CLASSIFICATION AND INDEX PROPERTIES FOR INTACT ROCK",
    "abstract": "Abstract : Physical and elastic properties of NX-size rock core from 27 localities were investigated in order to develop an engineering classification system for intact rock, and also to develop index properties related to important physical and engineering characteristics. Thirteen rock types are represented. Laboratory tests were conducted on these rocks as follows: unit weight, Shore scleroscope hardness, Schmidt hammer hardness, abrasion hardness, absorption, sonic-velocity stress-strain under cyclic loading to 5,000 psi, uniaxial stress-strain to failure, and point-load tensile strength. A total of 257 specimens with L/D ratios of 2:1 were tested. Statistical studies were conducted with the IBM 7094 computer to determine correlation and regression relationships for selected pairs of variables. A system of engineering classification is proposed in which rocks are classified on the basis of their strength and modulus properties either obtained directly from laboratory tests, or approximately from index properties recommended herein. Application of the proposed engineering classification system to data obtained by others is shown by individual charts for each of several different rock types. Five charts are presented for estimating the strength or modulus properties for intact rock from the numerical indices obtained by either the Schmidt hammer, the Shore scleroscope, or the sonic pulse velocity, all used in conjunction with the unit weight of the rock."

    "title": "A Troubling Analysis of Reproducibility and Progress in Recommender Systems Research",
    "abstract": "The design of algorithms that generate personalized ranked item lists is a central topic of research in the field of recommender systems. In the past few years, in particular, approaches based on deep learning (neural) techniques have become dominant in the literature. For all of them, substantial progress over the state-of-the-art is claimed. However, indications exist of certain problems in today's research practice, e.g., with respect to the choice and optimization of the baselines used for comparison, raising questions about the published claims. In order to obtain a better understanding of the actual progress, we have tried to reproduce recent results in the area of neural recommendation approaches based on collaborative filtering. The worrying outcome of the analysis of these recent works-all were published at prestigious scientific conferences between 2015 and 2018-is that 11 out of the 12 reproducible neural approaches can be outperformed by conceptually simple methods, e.g., based on the nearest-neighbor heuristics. None of the computationally complex neural methods was actually consistently better than already existing learning-based techniques, e.g., using matrix factorization or linear models. In our analysis, we discuss common issues in today's research practice, which, despite the many papers that are published on the topic, have apparently led the field to a certain level of stagnation."

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems act as a personalized decision guides, aiding users in decisions on matters related to personal taste. Most previous research on Recommender Systems has focused on the statistical accuracy of the algorithms driving the systems, with little emphasis on interface issues and the user's perspective. The goal of this research was to examine the role of transprency (user understanding of why a particular recommendation was made) in Recommender Systems. To explore this issue, we conducted a user study of five music Recommender Systems. Preliminary results indicate that users like and feel more confident about recommendations that they perceive as transparent."

    "title": "Treatment of Aspergillosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America",
    "abstract": "Aspergillus species have emerged as an important cause of life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. This expanding population is composed of patients with prolonged neutropenia, advanced HIV infection, and inherited immunodeficiency and patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and/or lung transplantation. This document constitutes the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America for treatment of aspergillosis and replaces the practice guidelines for Aspergillus published in 2000 [1]. The objective of these guidelines is to summarize the current evidence for treatment of different forms of aspergillosis. The quality of evidence for treatment is scored according to a standard system used in other Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. This document reviews guidelines for management of the 3 major forms of aspergillosis: invasive aspergillosis, chronic (and saprophytic) forms of aspergillosis, and allergic forms of aspergillosis. Given the public health importance of invasive aspergillosis, emphasis is placed on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the different forms of invasive aspergillosis, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, sinus aspergillosis, disseminated aspergillosis, and several types of single-organ invasive aspergillosis. There are few randomized trials on the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The largest randomized controlled trial demonstrates that voriconazole is superior to deoxycholate amphotericin B (D-AMB) as primary treatment for invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole is recommended for the primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis in most patients (A-I). Although invasive pulmonary aspergillosis accounts for the preponderance of cases treated with voriconazole, voriconazole has been used in enough cases of extrapulmonary and disseminated infection to allow one to infer that voriconazole is effective in these cases. A randomized trial comparing 2 doses of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) showed similar efficacy in both arms, suggesting that liposomal therapy could be considered as alternative primary therapy in some patients (A-I). For salvage therapy, agents include lipid formulations of amphotericin (LFAB; A-II), posaconazole (B-II), itraconazole (B-II), caspofungin (B-II), or micafungin (B-II). Salvage therapy for invasive aspergillosis poses important challenges with significant gaps in knowledge. In patients whose aspergillosis is refractory to voriconazole, a paucity of data exist to guide management. Therapeutic options include a change of class using an amphotericin B (AMB) formulation or an echinocandin, such as caspofungin (B-II); further use of azoles should take into account host factors and pharmacokinetic considerations. Refractory infection may respond to a change to another drug class (B-II) or to a combination of agents (B-II). The role of combination therapy in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis as primary or salvage therapy is uncertain and warrants a prospective, controlled clinical trial. Assessment of patients with refractory aspergillosis may be difficult. In evaluating such patients, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis should be established if it was previously uncertain and should be confirmed if it was previously known. The drug dosage should be considered. Management options include a change to intravenous (IV) therapy, therapeutic monitoring of drug levels, change of drug class, and/or combination therapy. Antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole can be recommended in the subgroup of HSCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis and in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis (A-I). Management of breakthrough invasive aspergillosis in the context of mould-active azole prophylaxis is not defined by clinical trial data. The approach to such patients should be individualized on the basis of clinical criteria, including host immunosuppression, underlying disease, and site of infection, as well as consideration of antifungal dosing, therapeutic monitoring of drug levels, a switch to IV therapy, and/or a switch to another drug class (B-III). Certain conditions of invasive aspergillosis warrant consideration for surgical resection of the infected focus. These include but are not limited to pulmonary lesions contiguous with the heart or great vessels, invasion of the chest wall, osteomyelitis, pericardial infection, and endocarditis (B-III). Restoration of impaired host defenses is critical for improved outcome of invasive aspergillosis (A-III). Recovery from neutropenia in a persistently neutropenic host or reduction of corticosteroids in a patient receiving high-dose glucocorticosteroids is paramount for improved outcome in invasive aspergillosis. A special consideration is made concerning recommendations for therapy of aspergillosis in uncommon sites, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis. There are very limited data on these infections, and most involve D-AMB as primary therapy simply because of its long-standing availability. Based on the strength of the randomized study, the panel recommends voriconazole for primary treatment of these very uncommon manifestations of invasive aspergillosis (B-III). Management of the chronic or saprophytic forms of aspergillosis varies depending on the condition. Single pulmonary aspergillomas may be best managed by surgical resection (B-III), whereas chronic cavitary and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis require long-term medical therapy (B-III). The management of allergic forms of aspergillosis involves a combination of medical and anti-inflammatory therapy. For example, management of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) involves the administration of itraconazole and corticosteroids (A-I). \u00a9 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

    "title": "Adaptive User Modeling with Long and Short-Term Preferences for Personalized Recommendation",
    "abstract": "User modeling is an essential task for online recommender systems. In the past few decades, collaborative filtering (CF) techniques have been well studied to model users' long term preferences. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have shown a great advantage in modeling users' short term preference. A natural way to improve the recommender is to combine both long-term and short-term modeling. Previous approaches neglect the importance of dynamically integrating these two user modeling paradigms. Moreover, users' behaviors are much more complex than sentences in language modeling or images in visual computing, thus the classical structures of RNN such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) need to be upgraded for better user modeling. In this paper, we improve the traditional RNN structure by proposing a time-aware controller and a content-aware controller, so that contextual information can be well considered to control the state transition. We further propose an attention-based framework to combine users' long-term and short-term preferences, thus users' representation can be generated adaptively according to the specific context. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-art methods consistently."

Currently, stochastic gradient (SG) method is one of the most popular algorithms for matrix factorization. However, as a sequential approach, SG is difficult to be parallelized for handling web-scale problems. In this article, we develop a fast parallel SG method, FPSG, for shared memory systems. By dramatically reducing the cache-miss rate and carefully addressing the load balance of threads, FPSG is more efficient than state-of-the-art parallel algorithms for matrix factorization."

In this paper, we provide a principled approach to handle selection biases by adapting models and estimation techniques from causal inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, and find that it is highly practical and scalable."

    "title": "Algorithm Overdependence: How the Use of Algorithmic Recommendation Systems Can Increase Risks to Consumer Well-Being",
    "abstract": "Consumers increasingly encounter recommender systems when making consumption decisions of all kinds. While numerous efforts have aimed to improve the quality of algorithm-generated recommendations, evidence has indicated that people often remain averse to superior algorithmic sources of information in favor of their own personal intuitions (a type II problem). The current work highlights an additional (type I) problem associated with the use of recommender systems: algorithm overdependence. Five experiments illustrate that, stemming from a belief that algorithms hold greater domain expertise, consumers surrender to algorithm-generated recommendations even when the recommendations are inferior. Counter to prior findings, this research indicates that consumers frequently depend too much on algorithm-generated recommendations, posing potential harms to their own well-being and leading them to play a role in propagating systemic biases that can influence other users. Given the rapidly expanding application of recommender systems across consumer domains, the authors believe that an appreciation and understanding of these risks is crucial to the effective guidance and development of recommendation systems that support consumer interests."

    "abstract": "How can we tailor assistance systems, such as recommender systems or decision support systems, to consumers\u2019 individual shopping motives? How can companies unobtrusively identify shopping motives without explicit user input? We demonstrate that eye movement data allow building reliable prediction models for identifying goal-directed and exploratory shopping motives. Our approach is validated in a real supermarket and in an immersive virtual reality supermarket. Several managerial implications of using gaze-based classification of information search behavior are discussed: First, the advent of virtual shopping environments makes using our approach straightforward as eye movement data are readily available in next-generation virtual reality devices. Virtual environments can be adapted to individual needs once shopping motives are identified and can be used to generate more emotionally engaging customer experiences. Second, identifying exploratory behavior offers opportunities for marketers to adapt marketing communication and interaction processes. Personalizing the shopping experience and profiling customers\u2019 needs based on eye movement data promises to further increase conversion rates and customer satisfaction. Third, eye movement-based recommender systems do not need to interrupt consumers and thus do not take away attention from the purchase process. Finally, our paper outlines the technological basis of our approach and discusses the practical relevance of individual predictors."

    "title": "Applying Differential Privacy to Matrix Factorization",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are increasingly becoming an integral part of on-line services. As the recommendations rely on personal user information, there is an inherent loss of privacy resulting from the use of such systems. While several works studied privacy-enhanced neighborhood-based recommendations, little attention has been paid to privacy preserving latent factor models, like those represented by matrix factorization techniques. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving matrix factorization by utilizing differential privacy, a rigorous and provable privacy preserving method. We propose and study several approaches for applying differential privacy to matrix factorization, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy trade-offs offered by each approach. We show that input perturbation yields the best recommendation accuracy, while guaranteeing a solid level of privacy protection."

    "abstract": "The 15D is a generic, comprehensive, 15-dimensional, standardized, self-administered measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that can be used both as a profile and single index score measure. This paper examines the acceptability, reliability, validity, discriminatory power and responsiveness to change of its health state descriptive system and valuation system and presents some examples of applications. As a profile measure on roughly comparable dimensions the 150 performs equally well as the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and SF-20, in some respects even better, and clearly better than EQ-5D. The remaining nine to ten dimensions of the 15D provide a large reserve in terms of discriminatory power and responsiveness to change. The valuation system is based on an application of the multiattribute utility theory. The single index score (15D score) on a 0\u20131 scale, representing the overall HRQoL, is calculated from the health state descriptive system by using a set of population-based preference or utility weights. The 15D scores are shown to be highly reliable, sensitive and responsive to change, generalisable at least in Western-type societies, and particularly valid for deriving quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for resource allocation purposes. The instrument is recommended by the Washington Panel and is available in several languages for clinical economic evaluation and population studies."

    "title": "Cold-Start Recommendation Using Bi-Clustering and Fusion for Large-Scale Social Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Social recommender systems leverage collaborative filtering (CF) to serve users with content that is of potential interesting to active users. A wide spectrum of CF schemes has been proposed. However, most of them cannot deal with the cold-start problem that denotes a situation that social media sites fail to draw recommendation for new items, users or both. In addition, they regard that all ratings equally contribute to the social media recommendation. This supposition is against the fact that low-level ratings contribute little to suggesting items that are likely to be of interest of users. To this end, we propose bi-clustering and fusion (BiFu)-a newly-fashioned scheme for the cold-start problem based on the BiFu techniques under a cloud computing setting. To identify the rating sources for recommendation, it introduces the concepts of popular items and frequent raters. To reduce the dimensionality of the rating matrix, BiFu leverages the bi-clustering technique. To overcome the data sparsity and rating diversity, it employs the smoothing and fusion technique. Finally, BiFu recommends social media contents from both item and user clusters. Experimental results show that BiFu significantly alleviates the cold-start problem in terms of accuracy and scalability."

    "abstract": "The production of guidelines for the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) fits the mandate of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support countries in the reinforcement of patient care. WHO commissioned external reviews to summarise evidence on priority questions regarding case-finding, treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), monitoring the response to MDR-TB treatment, and models of care. A multidisciplinary expert panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop recommendations. The recommendations support the wider use of rapid drug susceptibility testing for isoniazid and rifampicin or rifampicin alone using molecular techniques. Monitoring by sputum culture is important for early detection of failure during treatment. Regimens lasting \u2265 20 months and containing pyrazinamide, a fluoroquinolone, a second-line injectable drug, ethionamide (or prothionamide), and either cycloserine or p-aminosalicylic acid are recommended. The guidelines promote the early use of antiretroviral agents for TB patients with HIV on second-line drug regimens. Systems that primarily employ ambulatory models of care are recommended over others based mainly on hospitalisation. Scientific and medical associations should promote the recommendations among practitioners and public health decision makers involved in MDR-TB care. Controlled trials are needed to improve the quality of existing evidence, particularly on the optimal composition and duration of MDR-TB treatment regimens."

We combined the International Staging System (ISS) with chromosomal abnormalities (CA) detected by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization after CD138 plasma cell purification and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to evaluate their prognostic value in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM).Clinical and laboratory data from 4,445 patients with NDMM enrolled onto 11 international trials were pooled together. The K-adaptive partitioning algorithm was used to define the most appropriate subgroups with homogeneous survival.ISS, CA, and LDH data were simultaneously available in 3,060 of 4,445 patients. We defined the following three groups: revised ISS (R-ISS) I (n = 871), including ISS stage I (serum \u03b22-microglobulin level < 3.5 mg/L and serum albumin level \u2265 3.5 g/dL), no high-risk CA [del(17p) and/or t(4;14) and/or t(14;16)], and normal LDH level (less than the upper limit of normal range); R-ISS III (n = 295), including ISS stage III (serum \u03b22-microglobulin level > 5.5 mg/L) and high-risk CA or high LDH level; and R-ISS II (n = 1,894), including all the other possible combinations. At a median follow-up of 46 months, the 5-year OS rate was 82% in the R-ISS I, 62% in the R-ISS II, and 40% in the R-ISS III groups; the 5-year PFS rates were 55%, 36%, and 24%, respectively.The R-ISS is a simple and powerful prognostic staging system, and we recommend its use in future clinical studies to stratify patients with NDMM effectively with respect to the relative risk to their survival."

    "title": "Investigating serendipity in recommender systems based on real user feedback",
    "abstract": "Over the past several years, research in recommender systems has emphasized the importance of serendipity, but there is still no consensus on the definition of this concept and whether serendipitous items should be recommended is still not a well-addressed question. According to the most common definition, serendipity consists of three components: relevance, novelty and unexpectedness, where each component has multiple variations. In this paper, we looked at eight different definitions of serendipity and asked users how they perceived them in the context of movie recommendations. We surveyed 475 users of the movie recommender system, MovieLens regarding 2146 movies in total and compared those definitions of serendipity based on user responses. We found that most kinds of serendipity and all the variations of serendipity components broaden user preferences, but one variation of unexpectedness hurts user satisfaction. We found effective features for detecting serendipitous movies according to definitions that do not include this variation of unexpectedness. We also found that different variations of unexpectedness and different kinds of serendipity have different effects on preference broadening and user satisfaction. Among movies users rate in our system, up to 8.5% are serendipitous according to at least one definition of serendipity, while among recommendations that users receive and follow in our system, this ratio is up to 69%."

Recommender systems provide their users with recommendations on variety of personal and relevant items or activities. They can play a significant role in today's life whether in E-commerce or for daily decisions that we need to make. We introduce a hybrid approach for solving the problem of finding the ratings of unrated items in a user-item ranking matrix through a weighted combination of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. The proposed technique provides improvements in addressing two major challenges of recommender systems: accuracy of recommender systems and sparsity of data by simultaneously incorporating users' correlations and items ones. The evaluation of the system shows superiority of the solution compared to stand-alone user-based collaborative filtering or item-based collaborative filtering."

This behaviorally based, comprehensive systems approach is suggested as a means of achieving durable implementation of effective school-based interventions. Although the SWPBS approach is conceptually sound and comprised of supportable behavioral practices, further systems-level demonstrations and validations of efficacy, effectiveness, and expansion are recommended."

    "title": "Hybrid algorithms for recommending new items",
    "abstract": "Despite recommender systems based on collaborative filtering typically outperform content-based systems in terms of recommendation quality, they suffer from the new item problem, i.e., they are not able to recommend items that have few or no ratings. This problem is particularly acute in TV applications, where the catalog of available items (e.g., TV programs) is very dynamic. On the contrary, content-based recommender systems are able to recommend both old and new items but the general quality of the recommendations in terms of relevance to the users is low. In this article we present two different approaches for building hybrid collaborative+content recommender systems, whose purpose is to produce relevant recommendations, while overcoming the new item issue.

Here we present Pixie, a scalable graph-based real-time recommender system that we developed and deployed at Pinterest. Given a set of user-specific pins as a query, Pixie selects in real-time from billions of possible pins those that are most related to the query. To generate recommendations, we develop Pixie Random Walk algorithm that utilizes the Pinterest object graph of 3 billion nodes and 17 billion edges. Experiments show that recommendations provided by Pixie lead up to 50% higher user engagement when compared to the previous Hadoop-based production system. Furthermore, we develop a graph pruning strategy at that leads to an additional 58% improvement in recommendations. Last, we discuss system aspects of Pixie, where a single server executes 1,200 recommendation requests per second with 60 millisecond latency. Today, systems backed by Pixie contribute to more than 80% of all user engagement on Pinterest."

Watching videos online is very popular; it is estimated that 500 h of video are uploaded onto YouTube, a video-sharing service, every minute and that, by 2019, video formats will comprise more than 80% of Internet traffic. Health-related videos are very popular on YouTube, but their quality is always a matter of concern. One approach to enhancing the quality of online videos is to provide additional educational health content, such as websites, to support health consumers. This study investigates the feasibility of building a content-based recommender system that links health consumers to reputable health educational websites from MedlinePlus for a given health video from YouTube. The dataset for this study includes a collection of health-related videos and their available metadata. Semantic technologies (such as SNOMED-CT and Bio-ontology) were used to recommend health websites from MedlinePlus. A total of 26 healths professionals participated in evaluating 253 recommended links for a total of 53 videos about general health, hypertension, or diabetes. The relevance of the recommended health websites from MedlinePlus to the videos was measured using information retrieval metrics such as the normalized discounted cumulative gain and precision at K. The majority of websites recommended by our system for health videos were relevant, based on ratings by health professionals. The normalized discounted cumulative gain was between 46% and 90% for the different topics. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a semantic content-based recommender system to enrich YouTube health videos. Evaluation with end-users, in addition to healthcare professionals, will be required to identify the acceptance of these recommendations in a nonsimulated information-seeking context."

The algorithms contained in the recommender system determine the efficiency of the recommender systems. The question now is to find the most appropriate algorithms to meet users' needs. So far, the research carried out has focused on improving the accuracy of recommender systems. In this paper, we propose that the recommender system should move beyond the conventional accuracy criteria and take some other criteria into account, such as coverage, diversity, serendipity, scalability, adaptability, risk, novelty and so on. Experimental results with data from VELO indicate that people with different interest degree tend to prefer different algorithms; thus the use of various evaluation criteria to judge the performance of algorithm is meaningful."

Risk factors for obesity were considered to be sedentary lifestyles (convincing); a high intake of energy-dense, micronutrient-poor foods (convincing); heavy marketing of energy-dense foods and fast food outlets (probable); sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fruit juices (probable); adverse social and economic conditions\u2014developed countries, especially in women (probable). A broad range of strategies were recommended to reduce obesity prevalence including: influencing the food supply to make healthy choices easier; reducing the marketing of energy dense foods and beverages to children; influencing urban environments and transport systems to promote physical activity; developing community-wide programmes in multiple settings; increased communications about healthy eating and physical activity; and improved health services to promote breastfeeding and manage currently overweight or obese people. Conclusions: The increasing prevalence of obesity is a major health threat in both low- and high income countries. Comprehensive programmes will be needed to turn the epidemic around."

    "abstract": "To understand users' acceptance of the emerging trend of personality-based recommenders (PBR), we evaluated an existing PBR using the technology acceptance model (TAM). We also compare it with a baseline rating-based recommender in a within-subject user study. Our results show that while the personality-based recommender is perceived to be only slightly more accurate than the rating-based one, it is much easier to use. The side-by-side comparison also reveals that users significantly favor the personality-based recommender and have a significantly higher intention to use such a system again. Therefore, we believe that if users accepted rating-based recommenders, they are most likely to accept personality-based recommenders and personality-based recommenders have a high likelihood to be widely adopted despite the fact that rating-based recommenders are now the industry norm. We further point out some preliminary guidelines on how to design personality-based recommender systems."

The funding for the development of this Practice Guideline was provided by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Guiding Principles and Objectives GUIDING PRINCIPLES This document presents official recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in the setting of adults with cirrhosis. Unlike previous AASLD practice guidelines, the current guideline was developed in compliance with the Institute of Medicine standards for trustworthy practice guidelines and uses the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.1 Multiple systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to support the recommendations in this practice guideline. An enhanced understanding of the guideline can be obtained by reading the applicable portions of the systematic reviews. In addition, more detailed information may be found in the associated guidance document related to clinically important aspects of HCC that lacked sufficient evidence to warrant a systematic review. The guideline focuses on a broad spectrum of clinical practice, including surveillance of patients with cirrhosis for HCC, establishing the diagnosis of HCC, and various therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC. To address other issues on HCC such as epidemiology, staging, and additional aspects of diagnosis and treatment, the authors have created a new guidance document that will be published soon and is based upon the previous HCC AASLD guidelines by Bruix and Sherman.2 KEY QUESTIONS The guideline developers from the AASLD identified key questions that health care providers are faced with frequently in the evaluation and management of patients with HCC. These questions were: Should adults with cirrhosis undergo surveillance for HCC? If so, which surveillance test is best? Should adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC undergo diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic computed tomography (CT) or multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)? Should adults with cirrhosis and an indeterminate hepatic nodule undergo a biopsy, repeated imaging, or alternative imaging for the diagnostic evaluation? Should adults with Child\u2010Pugh class A cirrhosis and early\u2010stage HCC (T1 or T2) be treated with resection or local\u2010regional (LRT) therapy? Should adults with cirrhosis and HCC that has been resected or ablated successfully undergo adjuvant therapy? Should adults with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation and HCC (T1) be treated or undergo observation? Should adults with cirrhosis and HCC (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network [OPTN] T2) awaiting liver transplantation undergo transplantation alone or transplantation with bridging therapy while waiting? Should adults with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation and HCC beyond Milan criteria (T3) undergo transplantation after being down\u2010staged to within Milan criteria? Should adults with cirrhosis and HCC (T2 or T3, no vascular involvement) who are not candidates for resection or transplantation be treated with transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial radioembolization, or external radiation? Should adults with Child\u2010Pugh class A/B cirrhosis and advanced HCC with macrovascular invasion and/or metastatic disease be treated with systemic or locoregional therapies or no therapy? TARGET AUDIENCE This guideline is intended primarily for health care providers who care for patients with cirrhosis. Additionally, the guideline may inform policy decisions regarding patients with HCC. Background BURDEN OF DISEASE According to the World Health Organization, HCC is the fifth most common tumor worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer\u2010related death (http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/liver-new.asp). Male\u2010to\u2010female predominance is greater than 2:1 with liver cancer, and approximately 83% of the estimated 782,000 new HCC cases in 2012 occurred in less developed regions of the world, with East and South Asia plus sub\u2010Saharan Africa being the regions of highest incidence, Southern Europe and North America being the regions of intermediate incidence, and Northern Europe and South Central Asia being the regions of lowest incidence.3 The incidence of HCC has been rising rapidly in the United States over the last 20 years.4 According to estimates from the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, the United States will have witnessed an estimated 39,230 cases of HCC and 27,170 HCC deaths in 2016 (https://seer.cancer.gov). In addition, a recent study using the SEER registry projects that the incidence of HCC will continue to rise until 2030,5 with the highest increase in Hispanics, followed by African Americans and then Caucasians, with a decrease noted among Asian Americans. The increase in incidence of HCC in the United States is attributed primarily to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic, prompting Petrick et al.4 to suggest that preventive efforts should target the birth cohort with the highest prevalence of HCV infection (1945\u20101965). Recent data have also shown that metabolic disorders\u2014defined as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the metabolic syndrome\u2014contribute numerically more to the burden of HCC than any other risk factor including HCV infection,6 which is due primarily to the high prevalence of NAFLD in the population overall. HIGH\u2010RISK GROUP The presence of cirrhosis represents a key risk factor for the development of HCC. The prevalence of cirrhosis among patients with HCC has been estimated to be 85%\u201095%,7 and the HCC incidence rate among patients with cirrhosis has been shown to be 2%\u20104% per year.9 Therefore, patients with cirrhosis constitute a high\u2010risk group for efforts at prevention and early detection. The fact that patients with HCC have underlying liver disease impacts the management and therapeutic options substantially. The key questions posed above reflect common scenarios in this patient population and provide the framework for this practice guideline. We used the Child\u2010Pugh classification to define the underlying degree of liver dysfunction instead of the Model for End\u2010Stage Liver Disease (MELD) classification, mainly because it is more commonly used in this context. Methods of Guideline Development An experienced methodologist moderated and facilitated the process of selecting the aforementioned key questions. A group of AASLD content experts worked collaboratively with an independent research group specializing in conducting systematic reviews to synthesize the available evidence. The research group provided curated evidence summaries following the GRADE approach (Table 1).1 In this approach, the quality of evidence in each systematic review is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the domains of precision, directness, consistency, and risk of bias. Following a comprehensive analysis of each systematic review, the guideline writing group based its recommendations on the quality of the evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and other clinical considerations. Based on this assessment, the guideline writing group generated AASLD recommendations that are graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients). The strength of recommendation is not only determined by the quality of evidence. Other factors\u2014including the balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and feasibility of the recommended action\u2014all play a role in determining the strength of recommendations. Technical remarks are added to recommendations to help reconcile the level of the recommendation with the quality of the evidence and to facilitate implementation. Evidence profiles for the corresponding systematic review for each of the key questions are presented in the Appendix. For the key questions with sparse, indirect evidence, relevant studies are summarized after each recommendation. Table 1 - The GRADE Approach 1. Rating the quality of evidence Study design Initial rating of quality of evidence Rate down when: Rate up when: RCT High Risk of bias Large effect (e.g,. RR = 0.5) Moderate Inconsistency Very large effect (e.g., RR = 0.2) Imprecision Dose response gradient Observational Low Indirectness All plausible confounding would increase the association Very low Publication bias 2. Determinants of the strength of a recommendation Quality of evidence Balance of benefit and harms Patient values and preferences Resources and costs 3. Implication of the strength of a recommendation Strong Population: Most people in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not. Health care workers: Most people should receive the recommended course of action. Policy makers: The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations. Conditional Population: The majority of people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. Health care workers: Be prepared to help patients make a decision that is consistent with their values using decision aids and shared decision making. Policy makers: There is a need for substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders. For patients, a strong recommendation implies that most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not. For clinicians, this would imply that patients should receive the recommended course of action, with consistent benefits and few side effects. For policy makers, the recommendation could be adopted as a policy in most situations and potentially could be used as a quality measure. For strong recommendations, the recommendation is prefaced by \"The AASLD recommends...\"In contrast, a conditional recommendation (also sometimes termed a \"weak\" recommendation) for patients would imply that the majority of patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. For clinicians making a conditional recommendation, the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens is uncertain; and they should be prepared to help patients make a decision that is consistent with their own values using a shared decision\u2010making approach. For policy makers, this recommendation type could imply a need for substantial debate and involvement of all stakeholders and is likely insufficient to be used as a quality measure. For conditional recommendations, the recommendation is prefaced by \"The AASLD suggests...\" Table 2 - Clinical Questions Evaluated Question Population Intervention Comparison Outcome 1 Adults with cirrhosis Surveillance for HCC No surveillance Survival 2 Adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC Diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic CT Diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic MRI Sensitivity and specificity 3 Adults with cirrhosis and an indeterminate hepatic nodule Biopsy Repeated or alternative imaging Sensitivity and specificity 4 Adults with Child\u2010Pugh class A cirrhosis and stage T1 or T2 HCC Resection Local\u2010regional therapy Survival, recurrence, morbidity 5 Adults with cirrhosis and HCC successfully resected or ablated Adjuvant therapy No adjuvant therapy Survival 6 Adults with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation and T1 HCC Local\u2010regional therapy Observation Survival, progression to T3/waitlist dropout 7 Adults with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation and T2 HCC Bridging therapy Observation Survival, progression to T3/waitlist dropout 8 Adults with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation and T3 HCC Down\u2010staging and transplant No transplant Posttransplant survival, recurrence 9 Adults with cirrhosis and HCC (T2 or T3, no vascular involvement) who are not candidates for resection or transplantation Transarterial chemoembolization Transarterial radioembolization or external radiation Survival 10 Adults with Child\u2010Pugh class A/B cirrhosis and advanced HCC with macrovascular invasion and/or metastatic disease Systemic therapy Local\u2010regional therapy or no therapy Survival 1. Should Adults With Cirrhosis Undergo Surveillance for HCC, and If So, Which Surveillance Test Is Best? Recommendations 1A. The AASLD recommends surveillance of adults with cirrhosis because it improves overall survival. Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate Strength of Recommendation: Strong 1B. The AASLD suggests surveillance using ultrasound (US), with or without alpha\u2010fetoprotein (AFP), every 6 months. Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1C. The AASLD suggests not performing surveillance of patients with Child\u2010Pugh class C cirrhosis unless they are on the transplant waiting list, given the low anticipated survival for these patients. Quality/Certainty of the Evidence: Low Strength of Recommendation: Conditional Technical Remarks It is not possible to determine which type of surveillance test\u2014US alone or the combination of US plus AFP\u2014leads to a greater improvement in survival. The optimal interval of surveillance ranges from 4 to 8 months. Modification in surveillance strategy based on etiology of liver diseases or risk stratification models cannot be recommended at this time. BACKGROUND The goal of surveillance and screening is to reduce mortality.10 HCC meets the criteria for the development of a surveillance program11 given that patients with cirrhosis are a high\u2010risk group7 and can be readily identified. The previous AASLD guidelines on HCC2 summarize the populations at the highest risk to have chronic viral hepatitis B and cirrhosis due to HCV. A randomized surveillance study performed in another high\u2010risk group, hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, showed a 37% reduction in mortality for those who underwent surveillance.12 However, there are no randomized trials in Western populations with cirrhosis secondary to chronic HCV or fatty liver disease, and thus there is some controversy surrounding whether surveillance truly leads to a reduction in mortality in this population of patients with cirrhosis. Another source of controversy is which surveillance tests should be used. Although it is well established that US should be part of surveillance, it is unknown whether the addition of biomarkers such as AFP allows for improved survival. The previous AASLD guidelines recommend US as the primary modality.2 Because of these uncertainties, the aim of this question was to determine whether current data are in support of HCC surveillance in adults with cirrhosis, and if so, what type of surveillance is best. Evidence and Rationale The evidence profile of surveillance for HCC is included in Supporting Table 1, which uses the data from a recent systematic review on surveillance.13 There were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surveillance in patients with cirrhosis. There were 38 observational cohort studies that evaluated surveillance in patients with cirrhosis, making the overall quality of the evidence moderate (Supporting Table 1). The majority of the data was reported with 3\u2010year survival. The pooled 3\u2010year survival rate was 50.8% among the 4735 patients who underwent HCC surveillance, compared with only 27.9% among the 6115 patients without previous surveillance, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67\u20102.17; P < 0.001). There were six studies that controlled for lead\u2010time bias, and the improvement in survival persisted (3\u2010year survival rates of 39.7% for surveillance versus 29.1% without surveillance; P < 0.001). Of the 23 studies evaluated, 10 were considered high\u2010quality studies in which the 3\u2010year survival with surveillance was greater than no surveillance (45.6% versus 28.8%; P < 0.001.) In addition to improved survival, surveillance also led to an increase in the detection of early\u2010stage HCC, with an OR of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.88\u20102.33) compared with no surveillance. In terms of anticipated absolute effects, surveillance led to 163 per 1000 more patients detected at early stages compared with no surveillance. In addition, surveillance led to more curative treatments compared with no surveillance (61.8% versus 38.2%; P < 0.001). Thus, improvement in survival seen with surveillance appears to be due to higher early\u2010stage detection and higher curative treatment rates. The surveillance tests used most commonly were US and AFP. Of the studies identified, only four used US alone, whereas the rest relied on US and AFP at 6\u2010month intervals. The use of US plus AFP improves detection of early\u2010stage HCC compared with no surveillance, with an OR of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.80\u20102.60), whereas US alone had an OR of 2.04 (95% CI, 1.55\u20102.68). Both US alone and US plus AFP led to similar rates of curative treatment (OR, 2.23 for US [95% CI, 1.83\u20102.71] and 2.19 for US plus AFP [95% CI, 1.89\u20102.53]). There were no studies that directly compared US alone versus US plus AFP to determine which was superior in terms of early\u2010stage detection or curative therapy. The studies were also evaluated to determine whether US alone or US plus AFP improved survival. US plus AFP had a pooled risk ratio of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.76\u20101.97) for improving survival, whereas US alone had a slightly lower pooled risk ratio of 1.75 (95% CI, 1.56\u20101.98) for improving survival. There was no statistical difference between the two strategies. However, there are serious issues when comparing these surveillance tests for their impact on survival, which include: (1) no description of the trigger to perform a diagnostic test, (2) some studies appear to evaluate AFP or US rather than the combination, (3) no mention of the performance characteristics of these tests, and (4) most importantly, the studies were not powered to determine an improvement in survival. FUTURE RESEARCH Given the current burden of HCC and the projected continued increase in incidence of this tumor, better studies including appropriate study design comparing US with US plus AFP as surveillance strategies are needed. Such studies should evaluate the characteristics of US, including its operator dependency and reliability as a surveillance test in specific patient populations. In addition, it would be important to determine whether other serum biomarkers in addition to AFP complement US, such as des\u2010gamma carboxy prothrombin, AFP L3, and other novel serum tests.14 2. Should Adults With Cirrhosis and Suspected HCC Undergo Diagnostic Evaluation With Multiphasic CT or Multiphasic MRI? Recommendation 2. The AASLD recommends diagnostic evaluation for HCC with either multiphasic CT or multiphasic MRI because of similar diagnostic performance characteristics. Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low for CT versus MRI Strength of Recommendation: Strong Technical Remarks The selection of the optimal modality and contrast agent for a particular patient depends on multiple factors beyond diagnostic accuracy. These include modality availability, scan time, throughput, scheduling backlog, institutional technical capability, examination costs and charges, radiologist expertise, patient preference, and safety considerations. All studies were performed at academic centers. Because of the greater technical complexity of multiphasic MRI compared with multiphasic CT, generalizability to practices without liver MRI expertise is not yet established. BACKGROUND In patients with cirrhosis and suspected HCC, diagnostic imaging is used to noninvasively verify the presence of HCC (diagnosis) and determine its extent (radiological staging). The goals are to measure tumor burden, guide management, and help prioritize patients for possible liver transplantation. Unlike most other malignancies, the diagnosis of HCC can be established noninvasively, and treatment may be initiated based on imaging alone, without confirmatory biopsy. The rationale is that in patients with cirrhosis, the pretest probability of HCC is sufficiently high, and the pretest probability of lesions that may mimic HCC at imaging is sufficiently low such that a lesion meeting HCC imaging criteria can be assumed reliably and confidently to be HCC. Although there is strong consensus that the imaging diagnosis of HCC requires multiphasic imaging, there is not agreement about which diagnostic imaging test to use. Commonly used methods in clinical practice include multiphasic CT with extracellular agents, multiphasic MRI with extracellular agents (gadolinium\u2010based compounds that stay in the extracellular space and permit characterization of blood flow), and multiphasic MRI with gadoxetate disodium (a specific gadolinium\u2010based compound that accumulates in hepatocytes and permits characterization of hepatocellular \"function\" in addition to blood flow). EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE The evidence profile of diagnostic accuracy for HCC is included in Supporting Table 2, which uses the data from a de novo systematic review on imaging in HCC performed to address this question. There were no randomized comparative studies of CT versus MRI, no studies identified that compared multiphasic MRI with an extracellular agent versus multiphasic MRI with gadoxetate disodium, and no data on patient preference. There were 19 observational studies in patients with cirrhosis and suspected HCC that compared the per\u2010lesion diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI, reporting true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative values. An additional 14 studies reported only detection rate (sensitivity), but these are not further discussed, as sensitivity cannot be interpreted in the absence of data on specificity and/or positive predictive value. Quality of evidence was low and was downgraded because of the methodological limitations of the included studies, inconsistency across studies, and possible publication bias. The performance characteristics of these imaging modalities overall and for lesions of different sizes are reviewed below. With regard to overall accuracy, eight studies compared multiphasic MRI using an extracellular agent versus multiphasic CT. MRI with an extracellular agent provided higher pooled sensitivity than CT (0.76 [95% CI, 0.72\u20100.81] versus 0.63 [95% CI, 0.57\u20100.69]; P < 0.001) with similar specificity (0.78 [95% CI, 0.63\u20100.88] versus 0.82 [95% CI, 0.71\u20100.89]; P = 0.62). Eight studies compared multiphasic MRI with gadoxetate disodium versus multiphasic CT. MRI with gadoxetate disodium provided higher pooled sensitivity than CT (0.87 [95% CI, 0.79\u20100.93] versus 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64\u20100.81]; P < 0.02) with similar specificity (0.94 [95% CI, 0.90\u20100.97] versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.90\u20100.98]; P = 0.47). When looking specifically at lesions larger than 2 cm, three studies compared multiphasic MRI with an extracellular agent versus multiphasic CT and showed a similar pooled sensitivity, with a higher pooled specificity of 0.87 versus 0.7 (P = 0.02). Examining accuracy in HCC between 1 and 2 cm, there were six studies that compared multiphasic MRI versus CT, and this also showed similar sensitivity and specificity. For HCC <1 cm, two studies compared multiphasic CT versus multiphasic MRI with an extracellular agent. The sensitivity of MRI for <1 cm was significantly higher compared with CT (0.69 versus 0.49; P = 0.049), whereas the specificity was, at a trend level, lower (0.46 versus 0.69; P = 0.08). Although multiphasic MRI may be marginally more sensitive than CT in a pooled analysis of comparative studies, the differences in pooled diagnostic performance are insufficient to recommend MRI over CT. Mitigating factors include the low quality of the evidence, concerns about generalizability to nonacademic settings, and recognition that multiple factors beyond diagnostic accuracy inform the selection of optimal imaging modalities in individual patients. Compared with multiphasic CT, multiphasic MRI has important advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include greater soft tissue contrast, more comprehensive assessment of nodule and background liver tissue properties, and absence of ionizing radiation. Disadvantages include greater technical complexity, longer scan times, lower throughput, increased susceptibility to artifact, less consistent image quality (largely because of patient factors such as breath holding, difficulty holding still, or high\u2010volume ascites), larger number of potential contraindications, higher charges, and\u2014especially outside the United States\u2014lower availability and longer scheduling backlogs. From a patient perspective, CT is faster, more spacious, and provokes less claustrophobia, but it exposes patients to radiation. Both modalities require IV access and contrast agents, the use of which may be problematic in patients with acute kidney injury or chronic renal failure.15 FUTURE RESEARCH Although not used widely in North America, multiphasic contrast\u2010enhanced US also can be used to diagnose HCC noninvasively, and further studies are needed.17 Prospective studies should include multiphasic CT, multiphasic MRI with an extracellular agent, and multiphasic MRI with gadoxetate disodium 8, and data on costs and patient preference should be collected. Of note, a multicenter trial of US transplantation patients with HCC underwent both MRI and CT at multiple fixed time points while awaiting transplantation has recently completed enrollment and may further elucidate which technique is optimal in this particular patient population (NCT01082224.) 3. Should Adults With Cirrhosis and an Indeterminate Hepatic Nodule Undergo a Biopsy, Repeated Imaging, or Alternative Imaging for the Diagnostic Evaluation? Recommendations 3A. The AASLD suggests several options in patients with cirrhosis and an indeterminate nodule, including follow\u2010up imaging, imaging with an alternative modality or alternative contrast agent, or biopsy, but cannot recommend one option over the other. Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 3B. The AASLD suggests against routine biopsy of every indeterminate nodule. Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low Strength of Recommendation: Conditional Technical Remarks Biopsy may be required in selected cases, but its routine use is not suggested. Biopsy has the potential to establish a timely diagnosis in cases in which a diagnosis is required to affect therapeutic decision making; however, biopsy has a risk of bleeding, tumor seeding, and the possibility that a negative biopsy is due to the failure to obtain tissue representative of the nodule rather than a truly benign nodule. Stringent imaging criteria with high specificity for \u226510 mm HCC have been developed by the American College of Radiology through its Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI\u2010RADS),25 the OPTN,26 and previous AASLD guidelines,2 and include arterial phase hyperenhancement in combination with washout appearance and/or capsule appearance. Lesions that do not meet these guidelines or are smaller than 1 cm are considered indeterminate. BACKGROUND In its previous HCC clinical practice guidelines,2 the AASLD recommended biopsy for all indeterminate lesions initially detected by surveillance ultrasound, with the presumed rationale being that biopsy can establish a definitive diagnosis, thereby permitting earlier intervention. Because of its many limitations, however, biopsy may not be an optimal strategy in all cases. Biopsy is expensive, may cause anxiety or pain, and has a risk of complications, including tumor track seeding and bleeding.27 Sampling error, especially for very small lesions, is an additional drawback. A negative biopsy may not exclude malignancy, and repeated biopsies may be necessary to establish a diagnosis. Follow\u2010up imaging may be especially relevant in patients awaiting liver transplantation with a single small, indeterminate nodule, given that biopsy confirmation of <20 mm HCC would not change management or contribute to liver transplantation priority. Because there is controversy regarding optimal workup for an indeterminate nodule, the aim of this question was to determine whether current data are able to elucidate an optimal strategy. EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE The evidence profile is included in Supporting Table 2, which uses the data from a de novo systematic review on imaging in HCC performed to address this question. Based on an extensive search strategy detailed in the systematic review, there were no comparative studies identified that directly address this question, although two single\u2010center, noncomparative studies were identified that examined the role of biopsy. Forner et al.17 in 2008 reported outcomes for \u22642 cm hepatic nodules detected during surveillance ultrasound in patients with cirrhosis. The authors performed percutaneous biopsy of \u22642 cm nodules in addition to MRI and contrast\u2010enhanced US. They found a sensitivity and specificity of MRI to be 61.7% and 96.6%, whereas contrast\u2010enhanced US was 51.7% and 93.1% compared with the standard, which was biopsy. When both tests were in concordance, the sensitivity was only 33%, with 100% specificity. Biopsy had a false negative rate of 30%, as patients with suspicious imaging findings or growth were rebiopsied up to three times. In 2011, Khalili et al. 28 reported that in patients with cirrhosis,"

    "abstract": "Most recommender systems base their recommendations on implicit or explicit item-level feedback provided by users. These item ratings are combined into a complex user model, which then predicts the suitability of other items. While effective, such methods have limited scrutability and transparency. For instance, if a user's interests change, then many item ratings would usually need to be modified to significantly shift the user's recommendations. Similarly, explaining how the system characterizes the user is impossible, short of presenting the entire list of known item ratings. In this paper, we present a new set-based recommendation technique that permits the user model to be explicitly presented to users in natural language, empowering users to understand recommendations made and improve the recommendations dynamically. While performing comparably to traditional collaborative filtering techniques in a standard static setting, our approach allows users to efficiently improve recommendations. Further, it makes it easier for the model to be validated and adjusted, building user trust and understanding."

    "abstract": "One hundred cases were studied in detail using lymphangiograms (LAG), anatomic dissections, and/or microscopic evaluation. LAG performed via the dorsal lymphatics of the penis demonstrate the existence of specific lymph node center, the so-called sentinel lymph node (SLN). This appears to be the primary site of metastases from penile carcinoma. The SLN is visualized radio-graphically, on the antero-posterior view, at the junction of the femoral head and the ascending ramus of the pubis. Anatomically, the SLN is part of the lymphatic system around the superficial epigastric vein. Forty-six SLN biopsies were performed with 15 positve for metastatic disease. In these 15 patients, an inguinofemoroiliac dissection was performed; in 12 cases there was no involvement of other lymph nodes. Lymphatic channels draining into the iliac lymph nodes without first draining into the sentinel lymph node were never demonstrated, nor were the inguinal-femoral lymph nodes involved in the absence of SLN involvement. On this bases, we recommend preliminary bilateral SLN biopsy to be followed by inguinofemoroiliac dissection when biopsy of the SLN is positive. When biopsy of the SLN is negative for metastatic disease, no further sugical therapy is immediately indicated. With negative SLN, 5-year survival was 90%. When SLN alone was involved, 5-year survival was 70%. Five-year survival was 50% with both SLN and other inguinal nodes involved. When iliac metastases were also present, 3-year survival was 20%."

    "abstract": "Bug reports represent an important information source for software construction. Misclassification of these reports inevitably introduces bias. Manual examinations can help reduce the noise, but bring a heavy burden for developers instead. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage approach by combining both text mining and data mining techniques to automate the prediction process. The first stage leverages text mining techniques to analyze the summary parts of bug reports and classifies them into three levels of probability. The extracted features and some other structured features of bug reports are then fed into the machine learner in the second stage. Data grafting techniques are employed to bridge the two stages. Comparative experiments with previous studies on the same data\u2014three large-scale open-source projects\u2014consistently achieve a reasonable enhancement (from 77.4% to 81.7%, 76.1% to 81.6%, and 87.4% to 93.7%, respectively) over their best results in terms of overall performance. Additional comparative empirical experiments on other seven popular open-source systems confirm the findings. Moreover, based on the data obtained, we also empirically studied the impact relation between the underlying classifiers and various other properties of the combined model. A prototypical recommender system has been developed to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

    "title": "Efficient Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons",
    "abstract": "The ranking of n objects based on pairwise comparisons is a core machine learning problem, arising in recommender systems, ad placement, player ranking, biological applications and others. In many practical situations the true pairwise comparisons cannot be actively measured, but a subset of all n(n-1)/2 comparisons is passively and noisily observed. Optimization algorithms (e.g., the SVM) could be used to predict a ranking with fixed expected Kendall tau distance, while achieving an \u03a9 (n) lower bound on the corresponding sample complexity. However, due to their centralized structure they are difficult to extend to online or distributed settings. In this paper we show that much simpler algorithms can match the same \u03a9 (n) lower bound in expectation. Furthermore, if an average of O(n log(n)) binary comparisons are measured, then one algorithm recovers the true ranking in a uniform sense, while the other predicts the ranking more accurately near the top than the bottom. We discuss extensions to online and distributed ranking, with benefits over traditional alternatives."

    "title": "An MDP-based Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Typical Recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more appropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice, an MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the initial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models. We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based Recommender system."

    "title": "EDMF: Efficient Deep Matrix Factorization With Review Feature Learning for Industrial Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Recommendation accuracy is a fundamental problem in the quality of the recommendation system. In this article, we propose an efficient deep matrix factorization (EDMF) with review feature learning for the industrial recommender system. Two characteristics in user's review are revealed. First, interactivity between the user and the item, which can also be considered as the former's scoring behavior on the latter, is exploited in a review. Second, the review is only a partial description of the user's preferences for the item, which is revealed as the sparsity property. Specifically, in the first characteristic, EDMF extracts the interactive features of onefold review by convolutional neural networks with word-attention mechanism. Subsequently, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${L}_{0}$</tex-math></inline-formula> norm is leveraged to constrain the review considering that the review information is a sparse feature, which is the second characteristic. Furthermore, the loss function is constructed by maximum <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i> estimation theory, where the interactivity and sparsity property are converted as two prior probability functions. Finally, the alternative minimization algorithm is introduced to optimize the loss functions. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods, which show good industrial conversion application prospects, outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

    "title": "A market-based approach to recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely advocated as a way of coping with the problem of information overload for knowledge workers. Given this, multiple recommendation methods have been developed. However, it has been shown that no one technique is best for all users in all situations. Thus we believe that effective recommender systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and that some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate the various recommendations so that only the best of them (from whatever source) are presented to the user. To this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role. Specifically, this article presents the principled design of such a marketplace (including the auction protocol, the reward mechanism, and the bidding strategies of the individual recommendation agents) and evaluates the market's capability to effectively coordinate multiple methods. Through analysis and simulation, we show that our market is capable of shortlisting recommendations in decreasing order of user perceived quality and of correlating the individual agent's internal quality rating to the user's perceived quality."

    "abstract": "Recommendation is crucial in both academia and industry, and various techniques are proposed such as content-based collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, logistic regression, factorization machines, neural networks and multi-armed bandits. However, most of the previous studies suffer from two limitations: (1) considering the recommendation as a static procedure and ignoring the dynamic interactive nature between users and the recommender systems, (2) focusing on the immediate feedback of recommended items and neglecting the long-term rewards. To address the two limitations, in this paper we propose a novel recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement learning, called DRR. The DRR framework treats recommendation as a sequential decision making procedure and adopts an \"Actor-Critic\" reinforcement learning scheme to model the interactions between the users and recommender systems, which can consider both the dynamic adaptation and long-term rewards. Furthermore, a state representation module is incorporated into DRR, which can explicitly capture the interactions between items and users. Three instantiation structures are developed. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets are conducted under both the offline and online evaluation settings. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed DRR method indeed outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors."

Differently from the recommender systems proposed so far, SUGGEST 3.0 does not make use of any off-line component, and is able to manage Web sites made up of pages dynamically generated. To this purpose SUGGEST 3.0 incrementally builds and maintains historical information by means of an incremental graph partitioning algorithm, requiring no off-line component. The main innovation proposed here is a novel strategy that can be used to manage large Web sites. Experiments, conducted in order to evaluate SUGGEST 3.0 performance, demonstrated that our system is able to anticipate users' requests that will be made farther in the future, introducing a limited overhead on the Web server activity."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a popular class of recommender systems that are based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) and proposes a novel technique for diversifying the recommendations that they give to users. Items are clustered based on a unique notion of priority-medoids that provides a natural balance between the need to present highly ranked items vs. highly diverse ones. Our solution estimates items diversity by comparing the rankings that different users gave to the items, thereby enabling diversification even in common scenarios where no semantic information on the items is available. It also provides a natural zoom-in mechanism to focus on items (clusters) of interest and recommending diversified similar items. We present DiRec a plug-in that implements the above concepts and allows CF Recommender systems to diversify their recommendations. We illustrate the operation of DiRec in the context of a movie recommendation system and present a thorough experimental study that demonstrates the effectiveness of our recommendation diversification technique and its superiority over previous solutions."

When building a news recommender system, we should consider special features different from other recommender systems. Hot news topics are changing every moment, thus it is important to recommend right news at the right time. This paper aims to propose a new model, based on deep neural network, to analyse user preference for news recommender system. The model extracts interest keywords to characterize the user preference from the set of news articles read by that particular user in the past. The model utilizes characterizing features for news recommendation, and applies those to the keyword classification for user preference. For the keyword classification, we use deep neural network for online preference analysis, because adaptive learning is necessary to track changes of hot topics sensitively. The usefulness of our model is validated through experiments. In addition, the accuracy and diversity of the recommendation results is also analysed."

Most existing recommender systems implicitly assume one particular type of user behavior. However, they seldom consider user-recommender interactive scenarios in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system based on user-recommender interaction and evaluate its performance with recall and diversity metrics. First, we define the user-recommender interaction. The recommender system accepts user request, recommends N items to the user, and records user choice. If some of these items favor the user, she will select one to browse and continue to use recommender system, until none of the recommended items favors her. Second, we propose a hybrid recommender system combining random and k -nearest neighbor algorithms. Third, we redefine the recall and diversity metrics based on the new scenario to evaluate the recommender system. Experiments results on the well-known MovieLens dataset show that the hybrid algorithm is more effective than nonhybrid ones."

The traditional recommendation algorithms only consider the accuracy as the optimization objective. In this article, a many-objective optimization model consisting of the F1 measure, recommendation novelty, recommendation coverage, customer satisfaction, landmark similarity, and overfitting is constructed for recommendation. Then, to improve the recommendation performance, we propose to use a large-scale many-objective optimization algorithm based on problem transformation (LSMaOA) to optimize the matrix factorization model for the recommender system in the intelligent IoT systems. The experimental results show that LSMaOA is robust and can effectively optimize the model's six objectives. Compared with the knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm (KnEA), the grid-based evolutionary algorithm (GrEA), the large-scale multiobjective optimization framework (LSMOF), and the reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA), the proposed algorithm can promote the F1 measure by 7.78%, 13.63%, 21.85%, and 28.63%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Improving the performance of recommender systems using knowledge graphs is an important task. There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings."

This paper proposes a hybrid recommender system that combines the three most known recommender methods which are: the collaborative filtering (CF), the content-based filtering (CB) and the demographic filtering (DF). In order to implement these recommender methods, we have applied different machine learning algorithms which are the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) for both CB and CF and the decision tree for the DF. The hybridization is a good choice to make the best of their advantages and to overcome the cold start problem. To enhance the recommendation accuracy, we use two hybridization techniques: switching and weighted. For the weighted approach, a novel linear programming model is applied to obtain the optimal weights' values. An extensive experimental study is conducted based on different evaluation metrics using extracted data from TripAdvisor. Our results show that the hybrid method is more accurate than the other recommender approaches used separately."

    "title": "Is seeing believing?",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems use people's opinions about items in an information domain to help people choose other items. These systems have succeeded in domains as diverse as movies, news articles, Web pages, and wines. The psychological literature on conformity suggests that in the course of helping people make choices, these systems probably affect users' opinions of the items. If opinions are influenced by recommendations, they might be less valuable for making recommendations for other users. Further, manipulators who seek to make the system generate artificially high or low recommendations might benefit if their efforts influence users to change the opinions they contribute to the recommender. We study two aspects of recommender system interfaces that may affect users' opinions: the rating scale and the display of predictions at the time users rate items. We find that users rate fairly consistently across rating scales. Users can be manipulated, though, tending to rate toward the prediction the system shows, whether the prediction is accurate or not. However, users can detect systems that manipulate predictions. We discuss how designers of recommender systems might react to these findings."

Currently, several deep-learning-based methods are used in group recommendation to learn preferences of groups on items and predict the next ones in which groups may be interested. However, their recommendation effectiveness is disappointing. To address this challenge, this article proposes a novel model called a multiattention-based group recommendation model (MAGRM). It well utilizes multiattention-based deep neural network structures to achieve accurate group recommendation. We train its two closely related modules: vector representation for group features and preference learning for groups on items. The former is proposed to learn to accurately represent each group's deep semantic features. It integrates four aspects of subfeatures: group co-occurrence, group description, and external and internal social features. In particular, we employ multiattention networks to learn to capture internal social features for groups. The latter employs a neural attention mechanism to depict preference interactions between each group and its members and then combines group and item features to accurately learn group preferences on items. Through extensive experiments on two real-world databases, we show that MAGRM remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in solving a group recommendation problem."

This paper aims to present a hybrid recommender system which uses a knowledge\u2010based recommendation model to provide good cold start recommendations. Design/methodology/approach Hybridizing a collaborative system and a knowledge\u2010based system, which uses incomplete preference relations means that the cold start problem is solved. The management of customers' preferences, necessities and perceptions implies uncertainty. To manage such an uncertainty, this information has been modeled by means of the fuzzy linguistic approach. Findings The use of linguistic information provides flexibility, usability and facilitates the management of uncertainty in the computation of recommendations, and the use of incomplete preference relations in knowledge\u2010based recommender systems improves the performance in those situations when collaborative models do not work properly. Research limitations/implications Collaborative recommender systems have been successfully applied in many situations, but when the information is scarce such systems do not provide good recommendations. Practical implications A linguistic hybrid recommendation model to solve the cold start problem and provide good recommendations in any situation is presented and then applied to a recommender system for restaurants. Originality/value Current recommender systems have limitations in providing successful recommendations mainly related to information scarcity, such as the cold start. The use of incomplete preference relations can improve these limitations, providing successful results in such situations."

In this work, we introduce PinnerSage, an end-to-end recommender system that represents each user via multi-modal embeddings and leverages this rich representation of users to provides high quality personalized recommendations. PinnerSage achieves this by clustering users' actions into conceptually coherent clusters with the help of a hierarchical clustering method (Ward) and summarizes the clusters via representative pins (Medoids) for efficiency and interpretability. PinnerSage is deployed in production at Pinterest and we outline the several design decisions that makes it run seamlessly at a very large scale.

To assess the effect of such guidelines, we surveyed hospitals and obstetricians in Ontario before and after the release of a widely distributed and nationally endorsed consensus statement recommending decreases in the use of cesarean sections. These surveys, along with discharge data from hospitals reflecting actual practice, revealed that most obstetricians (87 to 94 percent) were aware of the guidelines and that most (82.5 to 85 percent) agreed with them. Attitudes toward the use of cesarean section were congruent with the recommendations even before their release. One third of the hospitals and obstetricians reported changing their practice as a consequence of the guidelines, and obstetricians reported rates of cesarean section in women with a previous cesarean section that were significantly reduced, in keeping with the recommendations (from 72.2 percent to 61.1 percent; P<0.01). The surveys also showed, however, that knowledge of the content of the recommendations was poor (67 percent correct responses). Furthermore, data on actual practice after the publication of the guidelines showed that the rates of cesarean section were 15 to 49 percent higher than the rates reported by obstetricians, and they showed only a slight change from the previous upward trend. We conclude that guidelines for practice may predispose physicians to consider changing their behavior, but that unless there are other incentives or the removal of disincentives, guidelines may be unlikely to effect rapid change in actual practice. We believe that incentives should operate at the local level, although they may include system-wide economic changes. (N Engl J Med 1989;321:1306\u201311.)"

In contrast to centralized recommender systems, in which there is a single centralized seller who has access to the complete inventory of items as well as the complete record of sales and user information, in decentralized recommender systems each seller/learner only has access to the inventory of items and user information for its own products and not the products and user information of other sellers, but can get commission if it sells an item of another seller. Therefore the sellers must distributedly find out for an incoming user which items to recommend (from the set of own items or items of another seller), in order to maximize the revenue from own sales and commissions. We formulate this problem as a cooperative contextual bandit problem, analytically bound the performance of the sellers compared to the best recommendation strategy given the complete realization of user arrivals and the inventory of items, as well as the context-dependent purchase probabilities of each item, and verify our results via numerical examples on a distributed data set adapted based on Amazon data. We evaluate the dependence of the performance of a seller on the inventory of items the seller has, the number of connections it has with the other sellers, and the commissions which the seller gets by selling items of other sellers to its users."

    "title": "Graph Trend Filtering Networks for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to provide personalized services to users and are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The key of recommender systems is to predict how likely users will interact with items based on their historical online behaviors, e.g., clicks, add-to-cart, purchases, etc. To exploit these user-item interactions, there are increasing efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite graph and then performing information propagation in the graph via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Given the power of GNNs in graph representation learning, these GNNs-based recommendation methods have remarkably boosted the recommendation performance. Despite their success, most existing GNNs-based recommender systems overlook the existence of interactions caused by unreliable behaviors (e.g., random/bait clicks) and uniformly treat all the interactions, which can lead to sub-optimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we investigate the drawbacks (e.g., non-adaptive propagation and non-robustness) of existing GNN-based recommendation methods. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a principled graph trend collaborative filtering method and propose the Graph Trend Filtering Networks for recommendations (GTN) that can capture the adaptive reliability of the interactions. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are presented to verify and understand the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

However, with the explosion of network volume, the problem of data sparsity that causes large-scale KG systems to calculate and manage difficultly has become more significant. For alleviating the issue, knowledge graph embedding is proposed to embed entities and relations in a KG to a low-, dense and continuous feature space, and endow the yield model with abilities of knowledge inference and fusion. In recent years, many researchers have poured much attention in this approach, and we will systematically introduce the existing state-of-the-art approaches and a variety of applications that benefit from these methods in this paper. In addition, we discuss future prospects for the development of techniques and application trends. Specifically, we first introduce the embedding models that only leverage the information of observed triplets in the KG. We illustrate the overall framework and specific idea and compare the advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Next, we introduce the advanced models that utilize additional semantic information to improve the performance of the original methods. We divide the additional information into two categories, including textual descriptions and relation paths. The extension approaches in each category are described, following the same classification criteria as those defined for the triplet fact-based models. We then describe two experiments for comparing the performance of listed methods and mention some broader domain tasks such as question answering, recommender systems, and so forth.

    "abstract": "In e-learning recommender systems, interpersonal information between learners is very scarce, which makes it difficult to apply collaborative filtering (CF) techniques to achieve recommendations. In this study, we propose a hybrid filtering recommendation approach (SI - IFL) combining learner influence model (LIM), self-organization based (SOB) recommendation strategy, and sequential pattern mining (SPM) together for recommending learning objects (LOs) to learners. The method works as follows: (i) LIM is applied to acquire the interpersonal information by computing the influence that a learner exerts on others. LIM consists of learner similarity, knowledge credibility, and learner aggregation, meanwhile, LIM is independent of ratings. Furthermore, to address the uncertainty and fuzzy natures of learners, intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL) is applied to optimize the LIM. (ii) A SOB recommendation strategy is applied to recommend the optimal learner cliques for active learners by simulating the influence propagation among learners. Influence propagation means that a learner can move towards active learners, and such behaviors can stimulate the moving behaviors of his/her neighbors. This SOB recommendation approach achieves a stable structure based on distributed and bottom-up behaviors of individuals. (iii) SPM is applied to decide the final learning objects (LOs) and navigational paths based on the recommended learner cliques. The experimental results demonstrate that SI - IFL can provide personalized and diversified recommendations, and it shows promising efficiency and adaptability in e-learning scenarios."

    "abstract": "In many recommender systems, users express item opinions through two kinds of behaviors: giving preferences and writing detailed reviews. As both kinds of behaviors reflect users' assessment of items, review enhanced recommender systems leverage these two kinds of user behaviors to boost recommendation performance. On the one hand, researchers proposed to better model the user and item embeddings with additional review information for enhancing preference prediction accuracy. On the other hand, some recent works focused on automatically generating item reviews for recommendation explanations with related user and item embeddings. We argue that, while the task of preference prediction with the accuracy goal is well recognized in the community, the task of generating reviews for explainable recommendation is also important to gain user trust and increase conversion rate. Some preliminary attempts have considered jointly modeling these two tasks, with the user and item embeddings are shared. These studies empirically showed that these two tasks are correlated, and jointly modeling them would benefit the performance of both tasks."

    "abstract": "Textile industries are responsible for one of the major environmental pollution problems in the world, because they release undesirable dye effluents. Textile wastewater contains dyes mixed with various contaminants at a variety of ranges. Therefore, environmental legislation commonly obligates textile factories to treat these effluents before discharge into the receiving watercourses. The treatment efficiency of any pilot-scale study can be examined by feeding the system either with real textile effluents or with artificial wastewater having characteristics, which match typical textile factory discharges. This paper presents a critical review of the currently available literature regarding typical and real characteristics of the textile effluents, and also constituents including chemicals used for preparing simulated textile wastewater containing dye, as well as the treatments applied for treating the prepared effluents. This review collects the scattered information relating to artificial textile wastewater constituents and organises it to help researchers who are required to prepare synthetic wastewater. These ingredients are also evaluated based on the typical characteristics of textile wastewater, and special constituents to simulate these characteristics are recommended. The processes carried out during textile manufacturing and the chemicals corresponding to each process are also discussed."

    "title": "Exploring personal impact for group recommendation",
    "abstract": "Group activities are essential ingredients of people's social life. The rapid growth of online social networking services has greatly boosted group activities by providing convenient platform for users to organize and participate in such activities. Therefore, recommender systems, as a critical component in social networking services, now face new challenges in supporting group activities. In this paper, we study the group recommendation problem, i.e., making recommendations to a group of people in social networking services. We analyze the decision making process in a group to propose a personal impact topic (PIT) model for group recommendations. The PIT model effectively identifies the group preference profile for a given group by considering the personal preferences and personal impacts of group members. Moreover, we further enhance the discovery of personal impact with social network information to obtain an extended personal impact topic (E-PIT) model. We have conducted comprehensive data analysis and evaluations on three real datasets. The results show that our proposed group recommendation techniques outperform baseline approaches."

    "abstract": "A recipe recommender system may stimulate healthful and varied eating, when the presented recipes fit the lifestyle of the user. As consumers face the barrier to change their eating and cooking behavior, we aim for a strategy to provide more healthful variations to routine recipes. In this paper, a similarity measure for recipes is derived by taking a user-centered approach. Such a measure can be used to recommend healthier alternatives to commonly selected meals, which are perceived to be similar. Recipes presented using this strategy may fit the demand for health and variation within the boundaries of a busy lifestyle. Having derived and evaluated a recipe similarity measure, we explore its use through an at-home trial."

    "abstract": "Many recommender systems suffer from popularity bias: popular items are recommended frequently while less popular, niche products, are recommended rarely or not at all. However, recommending the ignored products in the `long tail' is critical for businesses as they are less likely to be discovered. In this paper, we introduce a personalized diversification re-ranking approach to increase the representation of less popular items in recommendations while maintaining acceptable recommendation accuracy. Our approach is a post-processing step that can be applied to the output of any recommender system. We show that our approach is capable of managing popularity bias more effectively, compared with an existing method based on regularization. We also examine both new and existing metrics to measure the coverage of long-tail items in the recommendation."

These technologies have also shifted our research focus from 'single genes' to 'gene sets'. We have developed a web-based integrated data mining system, WebGestalt (http://genereg.ornl.gov/webgestalt/), to help biologists in exploring large sets of genes. WebGestalt is composed of four modules: gene set management, information retrieval, organization/visualization, and statistics. The management module uploads, saves, retrieves and deletes gene sets, as well as performs Boolean operations to generate the unions, intersections or differences between different gene sets. The information retrieval module currently retrieves information for up to 20 attributes for all genes in a gene set. The organization/visualization module organizes and visualizes gene sets in various biological contexts, including Gene Ontology, tissue expression pattern, chromosome distribution, metabolic and signaling pathways, protein domain information and publications. The statistics module recommends and performs statistical tests to suggest biological areas that are important to a gene set and warrant further investigation. In order to demonstrate the use of WebGestalt, we have generated 48 gene sets with genes over-represented in various human tissue types. Exploration of all the 48 gene sets using WebGestalt is available for the public at http://genereg.ornl.gov/webgestalt/wg_enrich.php."

Early research on recommender systems focuses on algorithms and their evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy using F-measures and other methodologies from signal-detection theory. Present research includes other aspects such as human factors that affect the user experience and interactive visualization techniques to support transparency of results and user control. In this paper, we analyze all publications on recommender systems from the scopus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus. Based on an analysis of these papers, future topics for recommender systems research are identified, which include more advanced support for user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing and applications in high risk domains."

    "title": "Social Recommendation with Strong and Weak Ties",
    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of online social networks, it is now well understood that social information is highly helpful to recommender systems. Social recommendation methods are capable of battling the critical cold-start issue, and thus can greatly improve prediction accuracy. The main intuition is that through trust and influence, users are more likely to develop affinity toward items consumed by their social ties. Despite considerable work in social recommendation, little attention has been paid to the important distinctions between strong and weak ties, two well-documented notions in social sciences. In this work, we study the effects of distinguishing strong and weak ties in social recommendation. We use neighbourhood overlap to approximate tie strength and extend the popular Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model to incorporate the distinction of strong and weak ties. We present an EM-based algorithm that simultaneously classifies strong and weak ties in a social network w.r.t. optimal recommendation accuracy and learns latent feature vectors for all users and all items. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise ranking methods in a variety of accuracy metrics."

We explain the main design issues behind our recommender. Our approach first filters items based on preferences and context, and then takes ratings of other users and additional information into account, which can be relayed from car to car in a VANET. We also outline other mobile scenarios for contextualized recommender systems: a system for recommending mobile applications based on user context, an approach to find relevant resources in mobile semantic personal information management and a decentralized recommender system for personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

One of the factors that determine the performance of a recommender system is user feedback, which has been traditionally communicated through the application of explicit and implicit feedback techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel video search interface that predicts the topical relevance of a video by analysing affective aspects of user behaviour. We, furthermore, present a method for incorporating such affective features into user profiling, to facilitate the generation of meaningful recommendations, of unseen videos. Our experiment shows that multimodal interaction feature is a promising way to improve the performance of recommendation."

Nowadays, many of the computer-tailoring health education systems are using the Internet for delivering different types of health education. Traditionally, these systems are designed for a specific health problem, with a predefined library of educational resources. These systems do not take advantage of the increasing amount of educational resources available on the Internet. One of the reasons is that the high availability of content is making it more difficult to find the relevant one. The problem of information overload has been addressed for many years in the field of recommender systems. This paper is focused on the challenges and opportunities of merging recommender systems with personalized health education. It also discusses the usage of social networks and semantic technologies within this approach."

Earlier research in trust-aware systems have shown that the ability of trust-based systems to make accurate predictions coupled with their robustness from shilling attacks make them a better alternative than traditional recommender systems. In this paper we propose an approach for improving accuracy of predictions in trust-aware recommender systems. In our approach, we first reconstruct the trust network. Trust network is reconstructed by removing trust links between users having correlation coefficient below a specified threshold value. For prediction calculation we compare three different approaches based on trust and correlation. We show through experiments on real life Epinions data set that our proposed approach of reconstructing the trust network gives substantially better prediction accuracy than the original approach of using all trust statements in the network."

    "abstract": "In the past 30 years, Kohn\u2013Sham density functional theory has emerged as the most popular electronic structure method in computational chemistry. To assess the ever-increasing number of approximate exchange-correlation functionals, this review benchmarks a total of 200 density functionals on a molecular database (MGCDB84) of nearly 5000 data points. The database employed, provided as Supplemental Data, is comprised of 84 data-sets and contains non-covalent interactions, isomerisation energies, thermochemistry, and barrier heights. In addition, the evolution of non-empirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is \u03c9B97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach. From the local GGAs, B97-D3, revPBE-D3, and BLYP-D3 are recommended, while from the local meta-GGAs, B97M-rV is the leading choice, followed by MS1-D3 and M06-L-D3. The best hybrid GGAs are \u03c9B97X-V, \u03c9B97X-D3, and \u03c9B97X-D, while useful hybrid meta-GGAs (besides \u03c9B97M-V) include \u03c9M05-D, M06-2X-D3, and MN15. Ultimately, today's state-of-the-art functionals are close to achieving the level of accuracy desired for a broad range of chemical applications, and the principal remaining limitations are associated with systems that exhibit significant self-interaction/delocalisation errors and/or strong correlation effects."

Compared with traditional ones (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, and Dangdang), recommender systems built on location-based social networks (LBSNs) have received much attention. The former mine users\u2019 preferences through the relationship between users and items, e.g., online commodity, movies and music. The latter add location information as a new dimension to the former, hence resulting in a three-dimensional relationship among users, locations, and activities. In this article, we summarize LBSN recommender systems from the perspective of such a relationship. User, activity, and location are called objects, and recommender objectives are formed and achieved by mining and using such 3D relationships. From the perspective of the 3D relationship among these objects, we summarize the state-of-the-art of LBSN recommender systems to fulfill the related objectives. We finally indicate some future research directions in this area."

    "title": "Do social explanations work?",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems associated with social networks often use social explanations (e.g. \"X, Y and 2 friends like this\") to support the recommendations. We present a study of the effects of these social explanations in a music recommendation context. We start with an experiment with 237 users, in which we show explanations with varying levels of social information and analyze their effect on users' decisions. We distinguish between two key decisions: the likelihood of checking out the recommended artist, and the actual rating of the artist based on listening to several songs. We find that while the explanations do have some influence on the likelihood, there is little correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the same artist. Based on these insights, we present a generative probabilistic model that explains the interplay between explanations and background information on music preferences, and how that leads to a final likelihood rating for an artist. Acknowledging the impact of explanations, we discuss a general recommendation framework that models external informational elements in the recommendation interface, in addition to inherent preferences of users."

Overall, articles were more likely to describe interventions focused on individual and interpersonal characteristics, rather than institutional, community, or policy factors. Interventions that focused on certain topics (nutrition and physical activity) or occurred in particular settings (schools) more successfully adopted a social ecological approach. Health education theory, research, and training may need to be enhanced to better foster successful efforts to modify social and political environments to improve health."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) based recommender systems have been attracting more and more attention in recent years due to their excellent performance in accuracy. Representing user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, a GNN model generates user and item representations by aggregating embeddings of their neighbors. However, such an aggregation procedure often accumulates information purely based on the graph structure, overlooking the redundancy of the aggregated neighbors and resulting in poor diversity of the recommended list. In this paper, we propose diversifying GNN-based recommender systems by directly improving the embedding generation procedure. Particularly, we utilize the following three modules: submodular neighbor selection to find a subset of diverse neighbors to aggregate for each GNN node, layer attention to assign attention weights for each layer, and loss reweighting to focus on the learning of items belonging to long-tail categories. Blending the three modules into GNN, we present DGRec(Diversified GNN-based Recommender System) for diversified recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the best diversity while keeping the accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art GNN-based recommender systems."

    "abstract": "The increasing role of recommender systems in many aspects of society makes it essential to consider how such systems may impact social good. Various modifications to recommendation algorithms have been proposed to improve their performance for specific socially relevant measures. However, previous proposals are often not easily adapted to different measures, and they generally require the ability to modify either existing system inputs, the system's algorithm, or the system's outputs. As an alternative, in this paper we introduce the idea of improving the social desirability of recommender system outputs by adding more data to the input, an approach we view as providing `antidote' data to the system. We formalize the antidote data problem, and develop optimization-based solutions. We take as our model system the matrix factorization approach to recommendation, and we propose a set of measures to capture the polarization or fairness of recommendations. We then show how to generate antidote data for each measure, pointing out a number of computational efficiencies, and discuss the impact on overall system accuracy. Our experiments show that a modest budget for antidote data can lead to significant improvements in the polarization or fairness of recommendations."

Although traditional recommender systems are widely adopted but they are unable to generate effective recommendations in case of multi-dimensionality i.e. multi-criteria ratings, contextual information, side information etc. The curse of dimensionality is the major issue in the recommendation systems. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a clustering approach to incorporate multi-criteria ratings into traditional recommender systems effectively. Furthermore, we compute the intra-cluster user similarities using a Mahalanobis distance method in order to make more accurate recommendations and compared the proposed approach with the traditional collaborative filtering based method using Yahoo!

These recommender systems help users in making decision by suggesting products and services that satisfy the users' tastes and preferences. Collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation are two fundamental methods used to develop recommender systems. Although, both methods have their own advantages, they fail in some situations such as the 'cold start' where new users or items are added in the system. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines collaborative filtering, content-based and demographic filtering approaches to develop a recommender system for predicting ratings in a dynamic way. We show through experiments that our approach achieves good accuracy and high coverage and outperforms the conventional filtering algorithms as well as the naive hybrid methods. Moreover, we show how our approach deals with the cold-start problem by incorporating demographic characteristics of users."

Most of the previous studies focus overwhelmingly on recommendation accuracy as the only important factor, while overlooking the significance of diversity and novelty that indeed provide the vitality of the system. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm based on the preferential diffusion process on a user-object bipartite network. Numerical analyses on two benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Netflix, indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it can not only provide more accurate recommendations, but also generate more diverse and novel recommendations by accurately recommending unpopular objects."

In this paper, we address this problem by jointly considering multiple heterogeneous link prediction tasks such as predicting links between users and different types of items including books, movies and songs, which we refer to as the collective link prediction (CLP) problem. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian framework for solving the CLP problem, which allows knowledge to be adaptively transferred across heterogeneous tasks while taking into account the similarities between tasks. We learn the inter-task similarity automatically. We also introduce link functions for different tasks to correct their biases and skewness of distributions in their link data. We conduct experiments on several real world datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over several existing state-of-the-art methods."

Given the growing potential impact of such AI-based systems on individuals, organizations, and society, questions of fairness have gained increased attention in recent years. However, research on fairness in recommender systems is still a developing area. In this survey, we first review the fundamental concepts and notions of fairness that were put forward in the area in the recent past. Afterward, through a review of more than 160 scholarly publications, we present an overview of how research in this field is currently operationalized, e.g., in terms of general research methodology, fairness measures, and algorithmic approaches. Overall, our analysis of recent works points to certain research gaps. In particular, we find that in many research works in computer science, very abstract problem operationalizations are prevalent and questions of the underlying normative claims and what represents a fair recommendation in the context of a given application are often not discussed in depth. These observations call for more interdisciplinary research to address fairness in recommendation in a more comprehensive and impactful manner."

    "title": "UltraGCN",
    "abstract": "With the recent success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), they have been widely applied for recommendation, and achieved impressive performance gains. The core of GCNs lies in its message passing mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information. However, we observed that message passing largely slows down the convergence of GCNs during training, especially for large-scale recommender systems, which hinders their wide adoption. LightGCN makes an early attempt to simplify GCNs for collaborative filtering by omitting feature transformations and nonlinear activations. In this paper, we take one step further to propose an ultra-simplified formulation of GCNs (dubbed UltraGCN), which skips infinite layers of message passing for efficient recommendation. Instead of explicit message passing, UltraGCN resorts to directly approximate the limit of infinite-layer graph convolutions via a constraint loss. Meanwhile, UltraGCN allows for more appropriate edge weight assignments and flexible adjustment of the relative importances among different types of relationships. This finally yields a simple yet effective UltraGCN model, which is easy to implement and efficient to train. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that UltraGCN not only outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN models but also achieves more than 10x speedup over LightGCN."

Such decisions have an important global effect on society \\citewilliams2007social. Our contributions include a mathematical formalization of this question as an optimization problem and an exact, time-efficient algorithm. We also prove that there always exists a graph with $O(n/\u03b5^2)$ edges that is a $(1+\u03b5)$ approximation to the optimum. Our formulation is an instance of optimization over \\em graph topologies, see also \\citeboyd2004fastest,daitch2009fitting,sun2006fastest. Furthermore, for a given graph, we show how to optimize the same objective over the agents\u00bb innate opinions in polynomial time. Finally, we perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and real-world data that verify their value as mining tools to better understand the trade-off between of disagreement and polarization. We find that there is a lot of space to reduce both controversy and disagreement in real-world networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments on politics, our methods achieve a reduction in controversy and disagreement of the order $6.2 \\times 10^4$."

    "abstract": "A recommender system (RS) relying on latent factor analysis usually adopts stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as its learning algorithm. However, owing to its serial mechanism, an SGD algorithm suffers from low efficiency and scalability when handling large-scale industrial problems. Aiming at addressing this issue, this study proposes a momentum-incorporated parallel stochastic gradient descent (MPSGD) algorithm, whose main idea is two-fold: a) implementing parallelization via a novel data-splitting strategy, and b) accelerating convergence rate by integrating momentum effects into its training process. With it, an MPSGD-based latent factor (MLF) model is achieved, which is capable of performing efficient and high-quality recommendations. Experimental results on four high-dimensional and sparse matrices generated by industrial RS indicate that owing to an MPSGD algorithm, an MLF model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art ones in both computational efficiency and scalability."

    "abstract": "On many online platforms, users can engage with millions of pieces of content, which they discover either organically or through algorithmically-generated recommendations. While the short-term benefits of recommender systems are well-known, their long-term impacts are less well understood. In this work, we study the user experience on Spotify, a popular music streaming service, through the lens of diversity\u2014the coherence of the set of songs a user listens to. We use a high-fidelity embedding of millions of songs based on listening behavior on Spotify to quantify how musically diverse every user is, and find that high consumption diversity is strongly associated with important long-term user metrics, such as conversion and retention. However, we also find that algorithmically-driven listening through recommendations is associated with reduced consumption diversity. Furthermore, we observe that when users become more diverse in their listening over time, they do so by shifting away from algorithmic consumption and increasing their organic consumption. Finally, we deploy a randomized experiment and show that algorithmic recommendations are more effective for users with lower diversity. Our work illuminates a central tension in online platforms: how do we recommend content that users are likely to enjoy in the short term while simultaneously ensuring they can remain diverse in their consumption in the long term?"

    "title": "An Investigation on Personalized Collaborative Filtering for Web Service Selection",
    "abstract": "The current Web service architecture addresses the service discovery problem, but not service selection. If we treat services as a special type of products from the service providers, existing techniques used for product selection can be applied to service selection. Among many existing techniques for product selection, one dominant approach is to use recommender systems. For example many ecommerce Web site, such as Ebay, Amazon and Epinions all have recommender system support to ease the burden of product selection. Recommender systems are classified into different types, which include content-based, collaborative and hybrid based systems which perform recommendation based on user/item data set. There is also multidimensional recommender system where the system supports multiple dimensions, such as user,item, and its quality attributes. This research investigates the fundamentals of different types of recommender systems, in particular, the collaborative filtering based approach using both two dimensional and multidimensional data. This study is to facilitate the development of a framework that supports service selection. In this project we are interested in applying a multidimensional collaborative recommender system for Web service selection. But before we propose the framework, we first perform experiments on the similarity measures used in collaborative filtering to fully understand the working process of normal collaborative filtering system. Pearson correlation and Vector Similarity are tested and compared using the MovieLens data set. This experiment is important to decide which of the similarity measures performs better in a two dimensional data set. Because the Quality of Service is often characterized by multiple criteria, different people/users may put stronger emphasis on certain criteria than others, two dimensional approach is over-simplified. Therefore we looked at the multi dimensional approach on product selection as well. An experiment using the multidimensional data collected in this research from Epinions.com is performed to study how it works on product selection. Finally, we draw from the experience of both two dimensional and multidimensional product selection and propose a framework for Web service selection which uses the multidimensional recommender system approach."

    "abstract": "With the increasing manufacture of expensive systems for the measurement of ambulatory blood pressure there is a need for potential purchasers to be able to satisfy themselves that the systems have been evaluated according to agreed criteria. The British Hypertension Society has, therefore, drawn up a protocol of requirements for the evaluation of these devices. This protocol incorporates many features of the American National Standard for Non-Automated Sphygmomanometers but includes many additional features, such as strict criteria for observer training, interdevice variability testing before and after a month of ambulatory use, and a new system of analysis which permits the test system to be graded. It is recommended that manufacturers of ambulatory blood pressure measuring devices should obtain an unbiased evaluation according to a recognized standard before a device is marketed."

    "abstract": "Machine learning has recently enabled large advances in artificial intelligence, but these tend to be highly centralized. The large datasets required are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query basis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to acquire more data and re-train them. We propose a framework for participants to collaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to host a continuously updated model. This model will be shared publicly on a blockchain where it can be free to use for inference. Ideal learning problems include scenarios where a model is used many times for similar input such as personal assistants, playing games, recommender systems, etc. In order to maintain the model's accuracy with respect to some test set we propose both financial and non-financial (gamified) incentive structures for providing good data. A free and open source implementation for the Ethereum blockchain is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/0xDeCA10B."

    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Personalized Recommendation: An Instance-Based Approach via Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems become increasingly popular and widely applied nowadays. The release of users' private data is required to provide users accurate recommendations, yet this has been shown to put users at risk. Unfortunately, existing privacy-preserving methods are either developed under trusted server settings with impractical private recommender systems or lack of strong privacy guarantees. In this paper, we develop the first lightweight and provably private solution for personalized recommendation, under untrusted server settings. In this novel setting, users' private data is obfuscated before leaving their private devices, giving users greater control on their data and service providers less responsibility on privacy protections. More importantly, our approach enables the existing recommender systems (with no changes needed) to directly use perturbed data, rendering our solution very desirable in practice. We develop our data perturbation approach on differential privacy, the state-of-the-art privacy model with lightweight computation and strong but provable privacy guarantees. In order to achieve useful and feasible perturbations, we first design a novel relaxed admissible mechanism enabling the injection of flexible instance-based noises. Using this novel mechanism, our data perturbation approach, incorporating the noise calibration and learning techniques, obtains perturbed user data with both theoretical privacy and utility guarantees. Our empirical evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets not only shows its high recommendation accuracy but also illustrates the negligible computational overhead on both personal computers and smart phones. As such, we are able to meet two contradictory goals, privacy preservation and recommendation accuracy. This practical technology helps to gain user adoption with strong privacy protection and benefit companies with high-quality personalized services on perturbed user data."

It seems that a combination among these fields may results in emerging a high potential and interesting field. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, there is no framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain. In order to study the applicability of the proposed framework, a recommender system based on the proposed framework is suggested. Since the proposed framework is novel, the suggested recommender system is novel. The suggested recommender system is compared with the existing recommender systems. The results show that the suggested recommender system has several benefits which are not available in the existing recommender systems."

However, Item-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques, as the most popular techniques of recommender systems, suffer from sparsity and new item limitations which result in producing inaccurate recommendations. The use of items' semantic information besides the inclusion of multi-criteria ratings can successfully alleviate such problems and generate more accurate recommendations. This paper proposes an Item-based Multi-Criteria Collaborative Filtering algorithm that integrates the items' semantic information and multi-criteria ratings of items to lessen known limitations of the item-based CF techniques. According to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm prove to be very effective in terms of dealing with both of the sparsity and new item problems and therefore produce more accurate recommendations when compared to standard item-based CF techniques."

In this paper, we propose a co-attentive multi-task learning model for explainable recommendation. Our model improves both prediction accuracy and explainability of recommendation by fully exploiting the correlations between the recommendation task and the explanation task. In particular, we design an encoder-selector-decoder architecture inspired by human's information-processing model in cognitive psychology. We also propose a hierarchical co-attentive selector to effectively model the cross knowledge transferred for both tasks. Our model not only enhances prediction accuracy of the recommendation task, but also generates linguistic explanations that are fluent, useful, and highly personalized.

However, in some domains like Mobile IPTV or Satellite Systems it might be impossible to generate a program schedule for each user, because of bandwidth limitations. A few approaches were proposed to generate group recommendations. However, these approaches take into account that groups of users already exist and no recommender system is able to detect intrinsic users communities. This paper describes an algorithm that detects groups of users whose preferences are similar and predicts recommendations for such groups. Groups of different granularities are generated through a modularity-based Community Detection algorithm, making it possible for a content provider to explore the trade off between the level of personalization of the recommendations and the number of channels. Experimental results show that the quality of group recommendations increases linearly with the number of groups created."

In this paper, we represent a social network as a star-structured hybrid graph centered on a social domain, which connects with other item domains. With this innovative representation, useful knowledge from an auxiliary domain can be transferred through the social domain to a target domain. Various factors of item transferability, including popularity and behavioral consistency, are determined. We propose a novel Hybrid Random Walk (HRW) method, which incorporates such factors, to select transferable items in auxiliary domains, bridge cross-domain knowledge with the social domain, and accurately predict user-item links in a target domain. Extensive experiments on a real social dataset demonstrate that HRW significantly outperforms existing approaches."

As the number of applications available increases, the users of mobile devices find it challenging to find new and relevant applications. The fact that these applications usually are browsed and downloaded from a mobile device, which has a smaller screen compared to desktop computers, makes this information overload even more intense. Recommender systems aid users in finding relevant applications. A challenge with such systems is that they traditionally need a user profile in order to produce recommendations, known as the new user problem. In this paper we present a context-aware recommender system for mobile applications which produces recommendations from the first use.

    "abstract": "Explainability and effectiveness are two key aspects for building recommender systems. Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information to achieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have some weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hard to explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta path-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define patterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable and complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model. The framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the cold-start issue. Extensive experiments1 show that our proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets. Our model demonstrates robust performance over \"noisy\" item knowledge graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities."

The limited resources in these systems make minimizing their context acquisition a practical need, and the uncertainty in the mobile environment makes missing and erroneous context inputs a major concern. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Bayesian networks (BNs) for building recommender systems that minimize context acquisition. Our learning approach iteratively trims the BN-based context model until it contains only the minimal set of context parameters that are important to a user. In addition, we show that a two-tiered context model can effectively capture the causal dependencies among context parameters, enabling a recommender system to compensate for missing and erroneous context inputs. We have validated our proposed techniques on a restaurant recommendation data set and a Web page recommendation data set. In both benchmark problems, the minimal sets of context can be reliably discovered for the specific users. Furthermore, the learned Bayesian network consistently outperforms the J4.8 decision tree in overcoming both missing and erroneous context inputs to generate significantly more accurate predictions."

Written customer review is a rich source of information that can offer insights into the recommender system. However, dealing with the customer feedback in text format, as unstructured data, is challenging. In this research, we extract those features from customer reviews and use them for similarity evaluation of the users and ultimately in recommendation generation. To do so, we developed a glossary of features for each product category and evaluated them for removing irrelevant terms using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, we employed a deep neural network to extract deep features from the reviews-characteristics matrix to deal with sparsity, ambiguity, and redundancy. We applied matrix factorization as the collaborative filtering method to provide recommendations. As the experimental results on the Amazon.com dataset demonstrate, our methodology improves the performance of the recommender system by incorporating information from reviews and produces recommendations with higher quality in terms of rating prediction accuracy compared to the baseline methods."

Previous work has explored recommending interesting locations; however, users would also benefit from recommendations for activities in which to participate at those locations along with suitable times and days. Thus, systems that provide collaborative recommendations involving multiple dimensions such as location, activities and time would enhance the overall experience of users.The relationship among these dimensions can be modeled by higher-order matrices called tensors which are then solved by tensor factorization. However, these tensors can be extremely sparse. In this paper, we present a system and an approach for performing multi-dimensional collaborative recommendations for Who (User), What (Activity), When (Time) and Where (Location), using tensor factorization on sparse user-generated data. We formulate an objective function which simultaneously factorizes coupled tensors and matrices constructed from heterogeneous data sources. We evaluate our system and approach on large-scale real world data sets consisting of 588,000 Flickr photos collected from three major metro regions in USA.

More objective data regarding cartilage injuries and more accurate methods to evaluate the operative outcomes are required, especially since new procedures are becoming increasingly expensive. There are many published reports on the outcomes of total joint replacement based on clinical scores and radiographic evaluations.

While perturbation methods work nicely for slightly nonlinear problems, the homotopy analysis technique addresses nonlinear problems in a more general manner. Through this method, the author demonstrates that a nonlinear problem that normally has a unique solution can have an infinite number of different solution expressions whose convergence region and rate are dependent on an auxiliary parameter. The method provides for ways to control and adjust the convergence region. This makes the method particularly suited for problems with strong nonlinearity. The book is comprised of two parts. Part I contains Chapters 1 through 5, while Part II contains Chapters 6 through 18. The first part covers the basic ideas and concepts of the method, while the second part focuses on applications of the method to different situations. In addition to introducing the method in Part I, the author discusses the relation of the method to other analytical methods as well as the advantages and limitations of the method. Applications discussed in Part II are varied in scope covering areas such as simple bifurcation of nonlinear problems, nonlinear eigenvalue problems, the Thomas-Fermi atom model, free oscillation systems with both odd and quadratic nonlinearities, Blasius' viscous flow, boundary layer flows with exponential and algebraic properties, von Karman's swirling viscous flow, and nonlinear progressive waves in deep water. The book should serve as an excellent reference to researchers, engineers, and interested individuals in helping them tackle nonlinear problems in an analytical fashion. It has a good subject index and an outstanding list of bibliography with 136 references cited. The book is very well written and is relatively easy to follow to the mathematically literate person.

Human emotions are widely regarded as important predictors of behavior and preference. They are a crucial factor in decision making, but until recently, relatively little has been known about the effectiveness of using human emotions in personalizing real-world recommender systems. In this paper we introduce the Emotion Aware Recommender System (EARS), a large scale system for recommending news items using user\u2019s self-assessed emotional reactions. Our original contribution includes the formulation of a multi-dimensional model of emotions for news item recommendations, introduction of affective item features that can be used to describe recommended items, construction of affective similarity measures, and validation of the EARS on a large corpus of real-world Web traffic. We collect over 13,000,000 page views from 2,700,000 unique users of two news sites and we gather over 160,000 emotional reactions to 85,000 news articles. We discover that incorporating pleasant emotions into collaborative filtering recommendations consistently outperforms all other algorithms. We also find that targeting recommendations by selected emotional reactions presents a promising direction for further research. As an additional contribution we share our experiences in designing and developing a real-world emotion-based recommendation engine, pointing to various challenges posed by the practical aspects of deploying emotion-based recommenders."

A good recommender system selects a certain item for a specific user by recognizing why the user might like the item.

This paper presents variational approaches for collaborative filtering to deal with auxiliary information. The proposed methods encompass variational autoencoders through augmenting structures to model the auxiliary information and to model the implicit user feedback. This augmentation includes the ladder network and the generative adversarial network to extract the low-dimensional representations influenced by the auxiliary information. These two augmentations are the first trial in the venue of the variational autoencoders, and we demonstrate their significant improvement on the performances in the applications of the collaborative filtering."

However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer's preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price will often alter a consumer's purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer's exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer's WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon's data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results suggest that this approach can help predict WTP, and boost consumer satisfaction as well as seller profit."

In this work, we improve the negative sampler by integrating the exposure data. We propose to generate high-quality negative instances by adversarial training to favour the dif\ufb01cult instances, and by optimizing additional objective to favour the real negatives in exposure data. However, this idea is non-trivial to implement since the distribution of exposure data is latent and the item space is discrete. To this end, we design a novel RNS method (short for Reinforced Negative Sampler) that generates exposure-alike negative instances through feature matching technique instead of directly choosing from exposure data. Optimized under the reinforcement learning framework, RNS is able to integrate user preference signals in exposure data and hard negatives. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our RNS method. Our implementation is available at: https://github. com/dingjingtao/ReinforceNS."

To address this challenge and to improve the recommendation effectiveness in IoT, a novel multimodal representation learning-based model (MRLM) has been proposed. In MRLM, two closely related modules were trained simultaneously; they are global feature representation learning and multimodal feature representation learning. The former was designed to learn to accurately represent the global features of items and users through simultaneous training on three tasks: 1) triplet metric learning; 2) softmax classification; and 3) microscopic verification. The latter was proposed to refine items' global features and to generate the final multimodal features by using items' multimodal description information. After MRLM converged, items' multimodal features and users' global features could be used to calculate users' preferences on items via cosine similarity. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, MRLM remarkably improved the recommendation effectiveness in IoT."

    "title": "Caching-aware recommendations: Nudging user preferences towards better caching performance",
    "abstract": "Caching decisions by default seek to maximize some notion of social welfare: the content to be cached is determined so that the maximum possible aggregate demand over all users served by the cache is satisfied. Recommendation systems, on the contrary, are oriented towards user individual preferences: the recommended content should be most appealing to the user so as to elicit further content consumption. In our paper we explore how these, phenomenically conflicting, objectives can be jointly addressed. To this end, we depart radically from current practice with recommender systems, and we approach them as network traffic engineering tools that can actively shape content demand towards optimizing user- and network-centric performance objectives. We formulate the resulting joint theoretical optimization problem of deciding on the cached content and the recommendations to each user so that the cache hit ratio is maximized subject to a maximum tolerable distortion that the recommendation should undergo. We conclude on its complexity, and we propose a practical algorithm for its solution. The algorithm is essentially a form of lightweight control over the user recommendations so that the recommended content is both appealing to the end user and more friendly to the caching system and the network resources."

    "abstract": "In this paper we examine the use of a matrix factorization technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) in item-based collaborative filtering. After a brief introduction to SVD and some of its previous applications in recommender systems, we proceed with a full description of our algorithm, which uses SVD in order to reduce the dimension of the active item's neighborhood. The experimental part of this work first locates the ideal parameter settings for the algorithm, and concludes by contrasting it with plain item-based filtering which utilizes the original, high dimensional neighborhood. The results show that a reduction in the dimension of the item neighborhood is promising, since it does not only tackle some of the recorded problems of recommender systems, but also assists in increasing the accuracy of systems employing it."

    "title": "Which app will you use next?",
    "abstract": "The application a smart phone user will launch next intuitively depends on the sequence of apps used recently. More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the current context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session interactional context. It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic representational context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the methodname algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate context bias, in addition to click bias (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20."

    "title": "Factorization vs. regularization",
    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommender systems often suffer from the sparsity problem, particularly for new and inactive users when they use the system. The emerging trend of social networking sites and their accommodation in other sites like e-commerce can potentially help alleviate the sparsity problem with their provided social relation data. In this paper, we have particularly explored a new kind of social relation, the membership, and its combined effect with friendship. The two type of heterogeneous social relations are fused into the CF recommender via a factorization process. Due to the two relations' respective properties, we adopt different fusion strategies: regularization was leveraged for friendship and collective matrix factorization (CMF) was proposed for incorporating membership. We further developed a unified model to combine the two relations together and tested it with real large-scale datasets at five sparsity levels. The experiment has not only revealed the significant effect of the two relations, especially the membership, in augmenting recommendation accuracy in the sparse data condition, but also identified the ability of our fusing model in achieving the desired fusion performance."

Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD."

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of location-based services, such as tour guide and location-based social network, we now have accumulated many location data on the Web. In this paper, we show that, by using the location data based on GPS and users' comments at various locations, we can discover interesting locations and possible activities that can be performed there for recommendations. Our research is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life: 1) if we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing, where should we go? 2) If we have already visited some places such as the Bird's Nest building in Beijing's Olympic park, what else can we do there? By using our system, for the first question, we can recommend her to visit a list of interesting locations such as Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest, etc. For the second question, if the user visits Bird's Nest, we can recommend her to not only do sightseeing but also to experience its outdoor exercise facilities or try some nice food nearby. To achieve this goal, we first model the users' location and activity histories that we take as input. We then mine knowledge, such as the location features and activity-activity correlations from the geographical databases and the Web, to gather additional inputs. Finally, we apply a collective matrix factorization method to mine interesting locations and activities, and use them to recommend to the users where they can visit if they want to perform some specific activities and what they can do if they visit some specific places. We empirically evaluated our system using a large GPS dataset collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 years in the real-world. We extensively evaluated our system and showed that our system can outperform several state-of-the-art baselines."

    "title": "Contextual and Sequential User Embeddings for Large-Scale Music Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users' preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream\u2014much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users' preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial."

    "abstract": "On the Internet, where the number of choices is overwhelming, there is need to filter, prioritize and efficiently deliver relevant information in order to alleviate the problem of information overload, which has created a potential problem to many Internet users. Recommender systems solve this problem by searching through large volume of dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized content and services. Recommender systems are a computer-based method that helps the user by generating suggestions about new items and products. It does so with the help of the past ratings of the item or analysing the preferences of the user's friends in the social network. The recommender system is further optimized by considering the user demographics which further help in filtering the output. Recommender systems have a wide range of applications. It ranges from movies music, news, books, products to research articles, search queries, social tags, etc. This paper explores the different characteristics and potentials of two different prediction techniques which include Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering in recommendation systems in order to serve as a compass for research and practice in the field of recommendation systems."

In the literature, researchers have been mainly dedicated to improving the recommendation performance (accuracy and diversity) of the algorithms while they have overlooked the influence of topology of the online user-object bipartite networks. In this paper, we find that some information provided by the bipartite networks is not only redundant but also misleading. With such \"less can be more\" feature, we design some algorithms to improve the recommendation performance by eliminating some links from the original networks. Moreover, we propose a hybrid method combining the time-aware and topology-aware link removal algorithms to extract the backbone which contains the essential information for the recommender systems. From the practical point of view, our method can improve the performance and reduce the computational time of the recommendation system, thus improving both of their effectiveness and efficiency."

    "title": "Learning Fair Representations for Recommendation: A Graph-based Perspective",
    "abstract": "As a key application of artificial intelligence, recommender systems are among the most pervasive computer aided systems to help users find potential items of interests. Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user\u2019s and each item\u2019s original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FairGo."

    "title": "Cross-Platform App Recommendation by Jointly Modeling Ratings and Texts",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the renaissance of Web technologies has transformed the online world into an application (App) driven society. While the abundant Apps have provided great convenience, their sheer number also leads to severe information overload, making it difficult for users to identify desired Apps. To alleviate the information overloading issue, recommender systems have been proposed and deployed for the App domain. However, existing work on App recommendation has largely focused on one single platform (e.g., smartphones), while it ignores the rich data of other relevant platforms (e.g., tablets and computers). In this article, we tackle the problem of cross-platform App recommendation, aiming at leveraging users\u2019 and Apps\u2019 data on multiple platforms to enhance the recommendation accuracy. The key advantage of our proposal is that by leveraging multiplatform data, the perpetual issues in personalized recommender systems\u2014data sparsity and cold-start\u2014can be largely alleviated. To this end, we propose a hybrid solution, STAR (short for \u201ccroSs-plaTform App Recommendation\u201d) that integrates both numerical ratings and textual content from multiple platforms. In STAR, we innovatively represent an App as an aggregation of common features across platforms (e.g., App\u2019s functionalities) and specific features that are dependent on the resided platform. In light of this, STAR can discriminate a user\u2019s preference on an App by separating the user\u2019s interest into two parts (either in the App\u2019s inherent factors or platform-aware features). To evaluate our proposal, we construct two real-world datasets that are crawled from the App stores of iPhone, iPad, and iMac. Through extensive experiments, we show that our STAR method consistently outperforms highly competitive recommendation methods, justifying the rationality of our cross-platform App recommendation proposal and the effectiveness of our solution."

On top of the huge amount of interconnected data, measuring relatedness between resources and identifying their relatedness could be used for various applications such as LOD-enabled recommender systems.

We evaluated the distance measures in the context of a recommender system that provides the top-N recommendations with baseline methods such as LDSD. Results show that the performance is significantly improved by our proposed distance measures incorporating normalizations that use both of the resources and global appearances of paths in a graph."

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF), the most successful information filtering technique for recommender systems, is either memory-based or model-based. While the former is more accurate, its scalability compared to model-based is poor. Moreover, the similarity functions used by most recommender systems are compensatory and allow very high (pros) and very low (cons) scores to compensate each other. This paper presents a hybrid movie recommender system that retains memory-based CF accuracy, model-based CF scalability, and alleviates the compensation problem of similarity functions. The proposed recommender system relies on a compact user model and fuzzy concordance/discordance principle. The user model speeds up the online process of generating a set of like-minded users within which a memory-based CF is carried out. The inter users comparison is done by using fuzzy concordance/discordance principle to alleviate the similarity compensation problem. The pros and cons between users are measured separately and then the overall statement about them is obtained by balancing the pros and cons within the set of criteria. Besides our approach is fast and compact, computational results reveal that it outperforms the classical one."

In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs which usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users' clicks on items) and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a crucial role in mitigating the information overload problem in social media by suggesting relevant information to users. The popularity of pervasively available social activities for social media users has encouraged a large body of literature on exploiting social networks for recommendation. The vast majority of these systems focus on unsigned social networks (or social networks with only positive links), while little work exists for signed social networks (or social networks with positive and negative links). The availability of negative links in signed social networks presents both challenges and opportunities in the recommendation process. We provide a principled and mathematical approach to exploit signed social networks for recommendation, and propose a model, RecSSN, to leverage positive and negative links in signed social networks. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We also perform further experiments to explicitly understand the effect of signed networks in RecSSN."

    "abstract": "The goal of a recommender system is to suggest items of interest to a user based on historical behavior of a community of users. Given detailed enough history, item-based collaborative filtering (CF) often performs as well or better than almost any other recommendation method. However, in cold-start situations - where a user, an item, or the entire system is new - simple non-personalized recommendations often fare better. We improve the scalability and performance of a previous approach to handling cold-start situations that uses filterbots, or surrogate users that rate items based only on user or item attributes. We show that introducing a very small number of simple filterbots helps make CF algorithms more robust. In particular, adding just seven global filterbots improves both user-based and item-based CF in cold-start user, cold-start item, and cold-start system settings. Performance is better when data is scarce, performance is no worse when data is plentiful, and algorithm efficiency is negligibly affected. We systematically compare a non-personalized baseline, user-based CF, item-based CF, and our bot-augmented user- and item-based CF algorithms using three data sets (Yahoo! Movies, MovieLens, and EachMovie) with the normalized MAE metric in three types of cold-start situations. The advantage of our \"na\u00efve filterbot\" approach is most pronounced for the Yahoo! data, the sparsest of the three data sets."

Data was obtained from the 44 nonpacemaker recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The data was split into two datasets with each dataset containing approximately 50 000 beats from 22 recordings. The first dataset was used to select a classifier configuration from candidate configurations. Twelve configurations processing feature sets derived from two ECG leads were compared. Feature sets were based on ECG morphology, heartbeat intervals, and RR-intervals. All configurations adopted a statistical classifier model utilizing supervised learning. The second dataset was used to provide an independent performance assessment of the selected configuration. This assessment resulted in a sensitivity of 75.9%, a positive predictivity of 38.5%, and a false positive rate of 4.7% for the SVEB class. For the VEB class, the sensitivity was 77.7%, the positive predictivity was 81.9%, and the false positive rate was 1.2%.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been attracting much attention from both academia and industry because of their ability to capture user interests and generate personalized item recommendations. As the life pace in contemporary society speeds up, traditional recommender systems are inevitably limited by their disconnected interaction styles and low adaptivity to users\u2019 evolving demands. Consequently, conversational recommender systems emerge as a prospective research area, where an intelligent dialogue agent is integrated with a recommender system. Conversational recommender systems possess the ability to accurately understand end-users\u2019 intent or request and generate human-like dialogue responses when performing recommendations. However, existing conversational recommender systems only allow the systems to ask users for more preference information, while users\u2019 further questions and concerns about the recommended items (e.g., enquiring the location of a recommended restaurant) can hardly be addressed. Though the recent task-oriented dialogue systems allow for two-way communications, they are not easy to train because of their high dependence on human guidance in terms of user intent recognition and system response generation. Hence, to enable two-way human-machine communications and tackle the challenges brought by manually crafted rules, we propose Conversational Recommender System with Adversarial Learning (CRSAL), a novel end-to-end system to tackle the task of conversational recommendation. In CRSAL, we innovatively design a fully statistical dialogue state tracker coupled with a neural policy agent to precisely capture each user\u2019s intent from limited dialogue data and generate conversational recommendation actions. We further develop an adversarial Actor-Critic reinforcement learning approach to adaptively refine the quality of generated system actions, thus ensuring coherent human-like dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets fully demonstrate the superiority of CRSAL on conversational recommendation tasks."

So far, much attention has been paid to designing new recommendation algorithms and improving existent ones. However, few works considered the different contributions from different users to the performance of a recommender system. Such studies can help us improve the recommendation efficiency by excluding irrelevant users. In this paper, we argue that in each online system there exists a group of core users who carry most of the information for recommendation. With them, the recommender systems can already generate satisfactory recommendation. Our core user extraction method enables the recommender systems to achieve 90% of the accuracy of the top-L recommendation by taking only 20% of the users into account. A detailed investigation reveals that these core users are not necessarily the large-degree users. Moreover, they tend to select high quality objects and their selections are well diversified."

Inspired by the generalizable modeling prowess of Model-Agnostic Meta Learning, we design a recommendation framework that is trained to be reasonably good enough for a wide range of users. During testing, to adapt to a specific user, the model parameters are updated by a few gradient steps. We evaluate our approach on three different benchmark datasets, from Movielens, Netflix, and MyFitnessPal. Through detailed simulation studies, we show that this framework handles the user cold-start model much better than state-of-the art benchmark recommender systems. We also show that the proposed approach performs well on the task of general recommendations to non cold-start users and effectively takes care of routine and eclectic preference trends of users."

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument was followed to provide a methodological strategy for the guideline development. A systematic review of the literature was performed for English language articles published up until December 2012 in order to address controversial issues in Barrett9s oesophagus including definition, screening and diagnosis, surveillance, pathological grading for dysplasia, management of dysplasia, and early cancer including training requirements. The rigour and quality of the studies was evaluated using the SIGN checklist system. Recommendations on each topic were scored by each author using a five-tier system (A+, strong agreement, to D+, strongly disagree). Statements that failed to reach substantial agreement among authors, defined as &gt;80% agreement (A or A+), were revisited and modified until substantial agreement (&gt;80%) was reached. In formulating these guidelines, we took into consideration benefits and risks for the population and national health system, as well as patient perspectives. For the first time, we have suggested stratification of patients according to their estimated cancer risk based on clinical and histopathological criteria. In order to improve communication between clinicians, we recommend the use of minimum datasets for reporting endoscopic and pathological findings. We advocate endoscopic therapy for high-grade dysplasia and early cancer, which should be performed in high-volume centres. We hope that these guidelines will standardise and improve management for patients with Barrett9s oesophagus and related neoplasia."

However, industrial recommender systems often aim at predicting a few items of immediate interest to the user, typically products that (s)he is likely to buy in the near future. In a collaborative filtering setting, the prediction may be based on the user's purchase history rather than rating information, which may be unreliable or unavailable. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of various collaborative filtering algorithms on a real-world dataset of purchase history from customers in a store of a French home improvement and building supplies chain. These experiments are part of the development of a prototype recommender system for salespeople in the store. We show how different settings for training and applying the models, as well as the introduction of domain knowledge may dramatically influence both the absolute and the relative performances of the different algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the influence of these parameters on the quality of the predictions of recommender systems has rarely been reported in the literature."

For models whose behavior depends on quantitative factors, we illustrate how robust design can be accomplished by using simple experimental designs in conjunction with response-surface metamodels. The results can yield new insights into system behavior, and may lead to recommended system configurations that differ substantially from those selected by analysis solely on the basis of mean response."

    "title": "Informing destination recommender systems design and evaluation through quantitative research",
    "abstract": "Purpose Destination recommender systems need to become truly human\u2010centric in their design and functionality. This requires a profound understanding of human interactions with technology as well as human behavior related to information search and decision\u2010making in the context of travel and tourism. This paper seeks to review relevant theories that can support the development and evaluation of destination recommender systems and to discuss how quantitative research can inform such theory building and testing. Design/methodology/approach Based on a review of information search and decision\u2010making literatures, a framework for the development of destination recommender systems is proposed and the implications for the design and evaluation of human\u2010centric recommender systems are discussed. Findings A variety of factors that influence the information search and processing strategies that influence interactions with a destination recommender system are identified. This reveals a great need for data\u2010driven models to inform recommender system processes. Originality/value The proposed framework provides a basis for future research and development in the area of destination recommender systems. The paper concludes that the success of a specific destination recommender system will depend largely on its ability to anticipate and respond creatively to transformations in the personal and situational needs of its users. Such system intelligence needs to be based on empirical data analyzed with sophisticated quantitative methods. The importance of recommender systems in tourism marketing is also discussed."

    "title": "Probabilistic Models for Unified Collaborative and Content-Based Recommendation in Sparse-Data Environments",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems leverage product and community information to target products to consumers. Researchers have developed collaborative recommenders, content-based recommenders, and (largely ad-hoc) hybrid systems. We propose a unified probabilistic framework for merging collaborative and content-based recommendations. We extend Hofmann's [1999] aspect model to incorporate three-way co-occurrence data among users, items, and item content. The relative influence of collaboration data versus content data is not imposed as an exogenous parameter, but rather emerges naturally from the given data sources. Global probabilistic models coupled with standard Expectation Maximization (EM) learning algorithms tend to drastically overfit in sparse-data situations, as is typical in recommendation applications. We show that secondary content information can often be used to overcome sparsity. Experiments on data from the ResearchIndex library of Computer Science publications show that appropriate mixture models incorporating secondary data produce significantly better quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Global probabilistic models also allow more general inferences than local methods like k-NN."

    "abstract": "The technical barriers for conversing with recommender systems using natural language are vanishing. Already, there are commercial systems that facilitate interactions with an AI agent. For instance, it is possible to say \"what should I watch\" to an Apple TV remote to get recommendations. In this research, we investigate how users initially interact with a new natural language recommender to deepen our understanding of the range of inputs that these technologies can expect. We deploy a natural language interface to a recommender system, we observe users' first interactions and follow-up queries, and we measure the differences between speaking- and typing-based interfaces. We employ qualitative methods to derive a categorization of users' first queries (objective, subjective, and navigation) and follow-up queries (refine, reformulate, start over). We employ quantitative methods to determine the differences between speech and text, finding that speech inputs are typically longer and more conversational."

    "abstract": "Session-based recommender systems have attracted much attention recently. To capture the sequential dependencies, existing methods resort either to data augmentation techniques or left-to-right style autoregressive training. Since these methods are aimed to model the sequential nature of user behaviors, they ignore the future data of a target interaction when constructing the prediction model for it. However, we argue that the future interactions after a target interaction, which are also available during training, provide valuable signal on user preference and can be used to enhance the recommendation quality."

    "title": "Meeting user information needs in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "In order to build relevant, useful, and effective recommender systems, researchers need to understand why users come to these systems and how users judge recommendation lists. Today, researchers use accuracy-based metrics for judging goodness. Yet these metrics cannot capture users' criteria for judging recommendation usefulness. We need to rethink recommenders from a user's perspective: they help users find new information. Thus, not only do we need to know about the user, we need to know what the user is looking for. In this dissertation, we explore how to tailor recommendation lists not just to a user, but to the user's current information seeking task. We argue that each recommender algorithm has specific strengths and weaknesses, different from other algorithms. Thus, different recommender algorithms are better suited for specific users and their information seeking tasks. A recommender system should, then, select and tune the appropriate recommender algorithm (or algorithms) for a given user/information seeking task combination. To support this, we present results in three areas. First, we apply recommender systems in the domain of peer-reviewed computer science research papers, a domain where users have external criteria for selecting items to consume. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through several sets of experiments. Second, we argue that current recommender systems research in not focused on user needs, but rather on algorithm design and performance. To bring users back into focus, we reflect on how users perceive recommenders and the recommendation process, and present Human-Recommender Interaction theory, a framework and language for describing recommenders and the recommendation lists they generate. Third, we look to different ways of evaluating recommender systems algorithms. To this end, we propose a new set of recommender metrics, run experiments on several recommender algorithms using these metrics, and categorize the differences we discovered. Through Human-Recommender Interaction and these new metrics, we can bridge users and their needs with recommender algorithms to generate more useful recommendation lists."

    "title": "Coevolutionary Recommendation Model",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a common recommendation approach that relies on user-item ratings. However, the natural sparsity of user-item rating data can be problematic in many domains and settings, limiting the ability to generate accurate predictions and effective recommendations. Moreover, in some CF approaches latent features are often used to represent users and items, which can lead to a lack of recommendation transparency and explainability. User-generated, customer reviews are now commonplace on many websites, providing users with an opportunity to convey their experiences and opinions of products and services. As such, these reviews have the potential to serve as a useful source of recommendation data, through capturing valuable sentiment information about particular product features. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning recommendation model, which co-learns user and item information from ratings and customer reviews, by optimizing matrix factorization and an attention-based GRU network. Using real-world datasets we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance, compared to a variety of alternatives. Furthermore, the approach is useful when it comes to assigning intuitive meanings to latent features to improve the transparency and explainability of recommender systems."

However, since users are often presented with slates of multiple items---which may have interacting effects on user choice---methods are required to deal with the combinatorics of the RL action space. We develop SlateQ, a decomposition of value-based temporal-difference and Q-learning that renders RL tractable with slates. Under mild assumptions on user choice behavior, we show that the long-term value (LTV) of a slate can be decomposed into a tractable function of its component item-wise LTVs. We demonstrate our methods in simulation, and validate the scalability and effectiveness of decomposed TD-learning on YouTube."

Simply asking the users what they want is too intrusive and prone to error, yet monitoring behaviour unobtrusively and finding meaningful patterns is both difficult and computationally time consuming. Capturing accurate user preferences is, however, an essential task if the information systems of tomorrow are to respond dynamically to the changing needs of their users. This thesis tests the hypothesis that using an ontology to represent user profiles offers advantages over traditional profile representations in the context of recommender systems. A novel ontology-based approach to recommendation is applied to a real world problem and empirically evaluated. Synergy between recommender systems and ontologies is then explored to help overcome both the recommender system cold-start problem and the ontology interest-acquisition problem. Finally, the visualization of profiles in ontological terms is examined in a real world situation and empirically evaluated."

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems have been introduced in Travel and Tourism applications in order to support interactive dialogues which assist users in acquiring their goals, e.g., travel planning in a dynamic packaging system. Notwithstanding this increased interactivity, these systems employ an interaction strategy that is specified a priori (at design time) and is followed quite rigidly during the interaction. In this paper we illustrate a new type of conversational recommender system which uses Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to autonomously learn an adaptive interaction strategy. After a successful validation in an off-line experiment (with simulated users), the approach is now applied within an online recommender system which is supported by the Austrian Tourism portal (Austria.info). In this paper, we present the methodology behind the adaptive conversational recommender system and a summarization of the most important issues which have been addressed in order to validate the approach in an online context with real users."

While rich content information is often available for both users and items few existing models can fully exploit it for personalization. Slow progress in this area can be partially attributed to the lack of publicly available benchmarks to validate and compare models. This year's ACM Recommender Systems Challenge' 17 aimed to address this gap by providing a standardized framework to benchmark cold start models. The challenge organizer XING released a large scaled data collection of user-job interactions from their career oriented social network. Unlike other competitions, here the participating teams were evaluated in two phases -- offline and online. Models were first evaluated on the held-out offline test set. Top models were then A/B tested in the online phase where new target users and items were released daily and recommendations were pushed into XING's live production system. In this paper we present our approach to this challenge, we used a combination of content and neighbor-based models winning both offline and online phases. Our model produced the most consistent online performance wining four of the five online weeks, and showed excellent generalization in the live A/B setting."

First, it incorporates topic threads to enforce natural semantic transitions towards the recommendation scenario. Second, it is created in a semi-automatic way, hence human annotation is more reasonable and controllable.

Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on three sub-tasks, namely topic prediction, item recommendation and response generation.

    "abstract": "The problem of finding the missing values of a matrix given a few of its entries, called matrix completion, has gathered a lot of attention in the recent years. Although the problem under the standard low rank assumption is NP-hard, Candes and Recht showed that it can be exactly relaxed if the number of observed entries is sufficiently large. In this work, we introduce a novel matrix completion model that makes use of proximity information about rows and columns by assuming they form communities. This assumption makes sense in several real-world problems like in recommender systems, where there are communities of people sharing preferences, while products form clusters that receive similar ratings. Our main goal is thus to find a low-rank solution that is structured by the proximities of rows and columns encoded by graphs. We borrow ideas from manifold learning to constrain our solution to be smooth on these graphs, in order to implicitly force row and column proximities. Our matrix recovery model is formulated as a convex non-smooth optimization problem, for which a well-posed iterative scheme is provided. We study and evaluate the proposed matrix completion on synthetic and real data, showing that the proposed structured low-rank recovery model outperforms the standard matrix completion model in many situations."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an automated and scalable garment recommender system using real-time in-store videos that can improve the experiences of garment shoppers and increase product sales. The video-based automated recommender (VAR) system is based on observations that garment shoppers tend to try on garments and evaluate themselves in front of store mirrors. Combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with marketing models of consumer preferences, the system automatically identifies shoppers\u2019 preferences based on their reactions and uses that information to make meaningful personalized recommendations. First, the system uses a camera to capture a shopper\u2019s behavior in front of the mirror to make inferences about her preferences based on her facial expressions and the part of the garment she is examining at each time point. Second, the system identifies shoppers with preferences similar to the focal customer from a database of shoppers whose preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions are known. Finally, recommendations are made to the focal customer based on the preferences, purchasing, and/or consideration decisions of these like-minded shoppers. Each of the three steps can be implemented with several variations, and a retailing chain can choose the specific configuration that best serves its purpose. In this paper, we present an empirical test that compares one specific type of VAR system implementation against two alternative, nonautomated personal recommender systems: self-explicated conjoint (SEC) and self-evaluation after try-on (SET). The results show that VAR consistently outperforms SEC and SET. A second empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of VAR in real-time applications. Participants in the second study enjoyed the VAR experience, and almost all of them tried on the recommended garments. VAR should prove to be a valuable tool for both garment retailers and shoppers.

In this paper, aiming at providing fundamental support to the research of social recommendation problem, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the correlations between social friend relations and user interest similarities. When evaluating interest similarities without distinguishing different friends a user has, we surprisingly observe that social friend relations generally cannot represent user interest similarities. A user's average similarity on all his/her friends is even correlated with the average similarity on some other randomly selected users. However, when measuring interest similarities using a finer granularity, we find that the similarities between a user and his/her friends are actually controlled by the network structure in the friend network. Factors that affect the interest similarities include subgraph topology, connected components, number of co-friends, etc. We believe our analysis provides substantial impact for social recommendation research and will benefit ongoing research in both recommender systems and other social applications."

As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision\u2010making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample's attitudes but similar to students' attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self\u2010esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision\u2010making biases: they are present biased, risk\u2010averse for gains, risk\u2010seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect\u2014with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results.

Such intelligent transportation systems aim to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines' computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the survey with respect to the different types of transportation data, movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and modeling and planning.

They leverage the relatively richer information, e.g., ratings, from the source domain or system to improve the recommendation accuracy in the target domain or system. Therefore, finding an accurate mapping of the latent factors across domains or systems is crucial to enhancing recommendation accuracy. However, this is a very challenging task because of the complex relationships between the latent factors of the source and target domains or systems. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Deep framework for both Cross-Domain and Cross-System Recommendations, called DCDCSR, based on Matrix Factorization (MF) models and a fully connected Deep Neural Network (DNN). Specifically, DCDCSR first employs the MF models to generate user and item latent factors and then employs the DNN to map the latent factors across domains or systems. More importantly, we take into account the rating sparsity degrees of individual users and items in different domains or systems and use them to guide the DNN training process for utilizing the rating data more effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DCDCSR framework outperforms the state-of-the-art CDR and CSR approaches in terms of recommendation accuracy."

We show that an independence assumption on the attributes of items leads to a set of independent models that can be optimised efficiently. Our approach results in interpretable topics that can be effectively turned into recommendations. Empirical results on a real world click log from a large e-commerce company exhibit highly accurate topic prediction rates of about 90%. Translating our approach into a topic-driven recommender system outperforms several baseline competitors."

We propose a modeling framework in which an individual\u2019s prepurchase expectation is shaped by (1) the product ratings she observes and (2) the perception of the review system she has at the time of the purchase. Upon product consumption, the individual obtains the postpurchase evaluation and encounters a certain level of disconfirmation. Drawing on the Bayesian learning framework, we model individual perception of the review system as a subjective attitude underlying how well the aggregate ratings match one\u2019s own usage experience. A hierarchical Bayesian model is developed and estimated using a rich data set comprising complete purchasing and rating activities on an e-commerce website. Our results suggest that an individual\u2019s decisions of whether to post a rating and what rating to post are affected by disconfirmation in two distinct manners. Specifically, an individual is more likely to leave a review when the magnitude of disconfirmation she encounters is larger. In addition, when the individual decides to review a product, the rating she chooses may not neutrally reflect her postpurchase evaluation; the direction of such a bias is in accordance with the sign of disconfirmation. We also observe several moderating effects: the disconfirmation effect on posting is attenuated by the time gap between purchase and receipt of the same product but accentuated by the dissension in product evaluations among peer consumers. A more granular examination reveals that infrequent raters are systematically more susceptible to disconfirmation than frequent posters. The insights from this research lead to actionable strategies for marketers and designers of recommender systems."

Rapid profiling of new users is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories. This work offers a new bootstrapping method, which is based on a concrete optimization goal, thereby handily outperforming known approaches in our tests."

In this paper we apply inductive learning algorithm to the recommendation process. Instead of computing user-user or item-item similarities, we construct a decision tree to represent user preference. Recommendations are performed by decision tree classification. To inspect the effectiveness of this technology, we set up a movie recommender system based on inductive learning and make online experiments for evaluation.

Empirical evidence suggests that the incorporation of a trust network among the users of a recommender system can significantly help to alleviate this problem. Hence, users are highly encouraged to connect to other users to expand the trust network, but choosing whom to connect to is often a difficult task. Given the impact this choice has on the delivered recommendations, it is critical to guide newcomers through this early stage connection process. In this paper, we identify several classes of key figures in the trust network, namely mavens, frequent raters and connectors. Furthermore, we introduce measures to assess the influence of these users on the amount and the quality of the recommendations delivered by a trust-enhanced collaborative filtering recommender system. Experiments on a dataset from Epinions.com support the claim that generated recommendations for new users are more beneficial if they connect to an identified key figure compared to a random user."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), spatial item recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting venues and events, especially when users travel out of town. However, this recommendation is very challenging compared to the traditional recommender systems. A user can visit only a limited number of spatial items, leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. Most of the items visited by a user are located within a short distance from where he/she lives, which makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far away place. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across different geographical regions. In light of this, we propose Geo-SAGE, a geographical sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation in this paper. Geo-SAGE considers both user personal interests and the preference of the crowd in the target region, by exploiting both the co-occurrence pattern of spatial items and the content of spatial items. To further alleviate the data sparsity issue, Geo-SAGE exploits the geographical correlation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial index structure called spatial pyramid. We conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results clearly demonstrate our Geo-SAGE model outperforms the state-of-the-art."

    "title": "Green solvents for sustainable organic synthesis: state of the art",
    "abstract": "The growing awareness of the pressing need for greener, more sustainable technologies has focused attention on the use of atom efficient catalytic methodologies for the manufacture of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Another aspect which is receiving increasing attention is the use of alternative reaction media that circumvent the problems associated with many of the traditional volatile organic solvents. The use of nonconventional reaction media also provides opportunities for facilitating the recovery and recycling of the catalyst. The state of the art in the use of alternative reaction media for green, sustainable organic synthesis is reviewed. Liquid\u2013liquid biphasic catalysis provides an industrially attractive method for the recovery and recycling of catalysts as an alternative to the more traditional solid heterogeneous catalysts. Various approaches to liquid\u2013liquid biphasic catalysis\u2014aqueous biphasic, fluorous biphasic, supercritical carbon dioxide, ionic liquids and various combinations thereof\u2014are reviewed and compared. \u201cThe best solvent is no solvent\u201d but if a solvent is needed then water has a lot to recommend it and catalysis in aqueous biphasic systems is an industrially attractive methodology which has found broad application. Similarly, supercritical carbon dioxide is an interesting reaction medium in the context of green chemistry and catalysis in various mono- and biphasic systems involving this solvent are reviewed. Fluorous biphasic systems and ionic liquids also have advantages in certain situations and the advantages and limitations of these media are compared. The ultimate in clean catalytic technologies is to telescope multistep syntheses into one-pot in the form of catalytic cascade processes. Examples of such catalytic cascades involving both chemo- and biocatalytic conversions are presented. Biocatalysis has a distinct advantage in this context in that the reactions all take place at or close to ambient temperature and pressure. In emulation of natural processes, where several different enzymes are compartmentalised in the cell, it can be advantageous to immobilise the various catalysts in such a cascade process. In this context, a novel and effective method for the immobilisation of enzymes as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) is discussed and the use of a combi CLEA, containing two enzymes, for the one-pot conversion of benzaldehyde to S-mandelic acid is reported."

    "title": "Inferring Networks of Substitutable and Complementary Products",
    "abstract": "In a modern recommender system, it is important to understand how products relate to each other. For example, while a user is looking for mobile phones, it might make sense to recommend other phones, but once they buy a phone, we might instead want to recommend batteries, cases, or chargers. These two types of recommendations are referred to as substitutes and complements: substitutes are products that can be purchased instead of each other, while complements are products that can be purchased in addition to each other. \r\nHere we develop a method to infer networks of substitutable and complementary products. We formulate this as a supervised link prediction task, where we learn the semantics of substitutes and complements from data associated with products. The primary source of data we use is the text of product reviews, though our method also makes use of features such as ratings, specifications, prices, and brands. Methodologically, we build topic models that are trained to automatically discover topics from text that are successful at predicting and explaining such relationships. Experimentally, we evaluate our system on the Amazon product catalog, a large dataset consisting of 9 million products, 237 million links, and 144 million reviews."

    "title": "News recommendation via hypergraph learning",
    "abstract": "Personalized news recommender systems have gained increasing attention in recent years. Within a news reading community, the implicit correlations among news readers, news articles, topics and named entities, e.g., what types of named entities in articles are preferred by users, and why users like the articles, could be valuable for building an effective news recommender. In this paper, we propose a novel news personalization framework by mining such correlations. We use hypergraph to model various high-order relations among different objects in news data, and formulate news recommendation as a ranking problem on fine-grained hypergraphs. In addition, by transductive inference, our proposed algorithm is capable of effectively handling the so-called cold-start problem. Extensive experiments on a data set collected from various news websites have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "The Web of Data is the natural evolution of the World Wide Web from a set of interlinked documents to a set of interlinked entities. It is a graph of information resources interconnected by semantic relations, thereby yielding the name Linked Data. The proliferation of Linked Data is for sure an opportunity to create a new family of data-intensive applications such as recommender systems. In particular, since content-based recommender systems base on the notion of similarity between items, the selection of the right graph-based similarity metric is of paramount importance to build an effective recommendation engine. In this paper, we review two existing metrics, SimRank and PageRank, and investigate their suitability and performance for computing similarity between resources in RDF graphs and investigate their usage to feed a content-based recommender system. Finally, we conduct experimental evaluations on a dataset for musical artists and bands recommendations thus comparing our results with two other content-based baselines measuring their performance with precision and recall, catalog coverage, items distribution and novelty metrics."

    "title": "Make It a Chorus",
    "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems mainly aim to model inherent and long-term user preference, while dynamic user demands are also of great importance. Typically, a historical consumption will have impacts on the user demands for its relational items. For instance, users tend to buy complementary items together (iPhone and Airpods) but not substitutive items (Powerbeats and Airpods), although substitutes of the bought one still cater to his/her preference. To better model the effects of history sequence, previous studies introduce the semantics of item relations to capture user demands for recommendation. However, we argue that the temporal evolution of the effects caused by different relations cannot be neglected. In the example above, user demands for headphones can be promoted after a long period when a new one is needed."

    "title": "Gaseous Diffusion Coefficients",
    "abstract": "Diffusion coefficients of binary mixtures of dilute gases are comprehensively compiled, critically evaluated, and correlated by new semi-empirical expressions. There are seventy-four systems for which the data are sufficiently extensive, consistent and accurate to allow diffusion coefficients to be recommended with confidence. Deviation plots are given for most of these systems. Almost every gaseous diffusion coefficient which was experimentally determined and reported prior to 1970 can be obtained from the annotated bibliography and table of gas pairs. A detailed analysis of experimental methods is given, and intercomparison of their results helps establish reliability limits for the data, which depend strongly on temperature. Direct measurements are supplemented by calculations based on knowledge of intermolecular forces derived from independent sources\u2014molecular beam scattering for high temperatures, and London dispersion constants for low temperatures. In addition, diffusion coefficients for several mixtures are obtained from experimental data on mixture viscosities and thermal diffusion factors. Combination of all these results gives diffusion coefficients over a very extensive temperature range, from very low temperatures to 10 000 K. All data are corrected for composition dependence and for quantum effects. New semi-empirical equations are derived for making such corrections easily."

    "abstract": "The earlier recommendations of the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE) for the treatment of human echinococcosis have had considerable impact in different settings worldwide, but the last major revision was published more than 10 years ago. Advances in classification and treatment of echinococcosis prompted experts from different continents to review the current literature, discuss recent achievements and provide a consensus on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Among the recognized species, two are of medical importance -Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis - causing cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), respectively. For CE, consensus has been obtained on an image-based, stage-specific approach, which is helpful for choosing one of the following options: (1) percutaneous treatment, (2) surgery, (3) anti-infective drug treatment or (4) watch and wait. Clinical decision-making depends also on setting-specific aspects. The usage of an imaging-based classification system is highly recommended. For AE, early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis with albendazole remains one of the key elements. However, most patients with AE are diagnosed at a later stage, when radical surgery (distance of larval to liver tissue of >2cm) cannot be achieved. The backbone of AE treatment remains the continuous medical treatment with albendazole, and if necessary, individualized interventional measures. With this approach, the prognosis can be improved for the majority of patients with AE. The consensus of experts under the aegis of the WHO-IWGE will help promote studies that provide missing evidence to be included in the next update."

    "title": "A Visual Dialog Augmented Interactive Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems rely on user feedback such as ratings or clicks to the items, to analyze the user interest and provide personalized recommendations. However, rating or click feedback are limited in that they do not exactly tell why users like or dislike an item. If a user does not like the recommendations and can not effectively express the reasons via rating and clicking, the feedback from the user may be very sparse. These limitations lead to inefficient model learning of the recommender system. To address these limitations, more effective user feedback to the recommendations should be designed, so that the system can effectively understand a user's preference and improve the recommendations over time. In this paper, we propose a novel dialog-based recommender system to interactively recommend a list of items with visual appearance. At each time, the user receives a list of recommended items with visual appearance. The user can point to some items and describe their feedback, such as the desired features in the items they want in natural language. With this natural language based feedback, the recommender system updates and provides another list of items. To model the user behaviors of viewing, commenting and clicking on a list of items, we propose a visual dialog augmented cascade model. To efficiently understand the user preference and learn the model, exploration should be encouraged to provide more diverse recommendations to quickly collect user feedback on more attributes of the items. We propose a variant of the cascading bandits, where the neural representations of the item images and user feedback in natural language are utilized. In a task of recommending a list of footwear, we show that our visual dialog augmented interactive recommender needs around 41.03% rounds of recommendations, compared to the traditional interactive recommender only relying on the user click behavior."

    "title": "Evaluating Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are considered as an answer to the information overload in a Web environment. Such systems recommend items (movies, music, books, news, web pages, etc.) that the user should be interested in. Collaborative filtering recommender systems have a huge success in commercial applications. The sales in these applications follow a power law distribution. However, with the increase of the number of recommendation techniques and algorithms in the literature, there is no indication that the datasets used for the evaluation follow a real world distribution. This paper introduces the long tail theory and its impact on recommender systems. It also provides a comprehensive review of the different datasets used to evaluate collaborative filtering recommender systems techniques and algorithms (EachMovie, MovieLens, Jester, BookCrossing, and Netflix). Finally, it investigates which of these datasets present a distribution that follows this power law distribution and which distribution would be the most relevant."

    "abstract": "We present a system for data-driven therapy decision support based on techniques from the field of recommender systems. Two methods for therapy recommendation, namely, Collaborative Recommender and Demographic-based Recommender , are proposed. Both algorithms aim to predict the individual response to different therapy options using diverse patient data and recommend the therapy which is assumed to provide the best outcome for a specific patient and time, that is, consultation. The proposed methods are evaluated using a clinical database incorporating patients suffering from the autoimmune skin disease psoriasis. The Collaborative Recommender proves to generate both better outcome predictions and recommendation quality. However, due to sparsity in the data, this approach cannot provide recommendations for the entire database. In contrast, the Demographic-based Recommender performs worse on average but covers more consultations. Consequently, both methods profit from a combination into an overall recommender system."

    "title": "Addressing cold start in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Cold start is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. In this paper we tackle the cold-start problem by proposing a context-aware semi-supervised co-training method named CSEL. Specifically, we use a factorization model to capture fine-grained user-item context. Then, in order to build a model that is able to boost the recommendation performance by leveraging the context, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble learning algorithm. The algorithm constructs different (weak) prediction models using examples with different contexts and then employs the co-training strategy to allow each (weak) prediction model to learn from the other prediction models. The method has several distinguished advantages over the standard recommendation methods for addressing the cold-start problem. First, it defines a fine-grained context that is more accurate for modeling the user-item preference. Second, the method can naturally support supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which provides a flexible way to incorporate the unlabeled data."

    "title": "Theoretical model for drop and bubble breakup in turbulent dispersions",
    "abstract": "Abstract A theoretical model for the prediction of drop and bubble (fluid\u2010particle) breakup rates in turbulent dispersions was developed. The model is based on the theories of isotropic turbulence and probability and contains no unknown or adjustable parameters. Unlike previous work, this model predicts the breakage rate for original particles of a given size at a given combination of the daughter particle sizes and thus does not need a predefined daughter particle size distribution. The daughter particle size distribution is a result and can be calculated directly from the model. Predicted breakage fractions using the model for the air\u2013water system in a high\u2010intensity pipeline flow agree very well with the available 1991 experimental results of Hesketh et al. Comparisons of the developed model for specific particle breakage rate with earlier models show it to give breakage\u2010rate values bracketed by other models. The spread in predictions is high, and improved experimental studies are recommended for verification."

    "title": "The UDP glycosyltransferase gene superfamily: recommended nomenclature update based on evolutionary divergence",
    "abstract": "This review represents an update of the nomenclature system for the UDP glucuronosyltransferase gene superfamily, which is based on divergent evolution. Since the previous review in 1991, sequences of many related UDP glycosyltransferases from lower organisms have appeared in the database, which expand our database considerably. At latest count, in animals, yeast, plants and bacteria there are 110 distinct cDNAs/ genes whose protein products all contain a characteristic 'signature sequence' and, thus, are regarded as members of the same superfamily. Comparison of a relatedness tree of proteins leads to the definition of 33 families. It should be emphasized that at least six cloned UDP-GlcNAc N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases are not sufficiently homologous to be included as members of this superfamily and may represent an example of convergent evolution. For naming each gene, it is recommended that the root symbol UGT for human (Ugt for mouse and Drosophila), denoting 'UDP glycosyltransferase,' be followed by an Arabic number representing the family, a letter designating the subfamily, and an Arabic numeral denoting the individual gene within the family or subfamily, e.g. 'human UGT2B4' and 'mouse Vgt2b5'. We recommend the name 'UDP glycosyltransferase' because many of the proteins do not preferen- tially use UDP glucuronic acid, or their nucleotide sugar preference is unknown. Whereas the gene is italicized, the corresponding cDNA, transcript, protein and enzyme activity should be written with upper-case letters and without italics, e.g. 'human or mouse UGT1 Al.' The VGT1 gene (spanning>500 kb) contains at least 12 promoters/first exons, which can be spliced and joined with common exons 2 through 5, leading to different JV-terminal halves but identical C-terminal halves of the gene products; in this scheme each first exon is regarded as a distinct gene (e.g. UGT1A1, UGT1A2,... UGT1A12). When an orthologous gene between species cannot be identified with certainty, as occurs in the UGT2B subfamily, sequential naming of the genes is being carried out chronologically as they become characterized. We suggest that the Human Gene Nomenclature Guidelines (http://wwvy.gene.acl.ac.uk/nomenclature/guidelines.html) be used for all species other than the mouse and Drosophila. Thirty published human UGT1A1 mutant alleles responsible for clinical hyperbilirubinemias are listed herein, and given numbers following an asterisk (e.g. UGT1A1*3O) consistent with the Human Gene Nomenclature Guidelines. It is anticipated that this VGT gene nomenclature system will require updating on a regular basis."

We continue our previous work that emphasizes on \"prioritized user-profile\" approach as an effective approach to increase the quality of the recommendations. Prioritized user-profile is an approach that tries to implement more personalized recommendation by assigning different priority importance to each of the features of the user-profile for different users. In order to find the optimal priorities for each user an optimization algorithm is needed. In this paper, we employ a new optimization algorithm namely invasive weed optimization (IWO) for this purpose. IWO is a relatively new and simple algorithm inspired from the invasive habits of growth of weeds in nature. Experimental results showed that IWO achieved the best accuracy in predicting users' interests compared to two other prioritized approaches which were based on genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and to standard user-based Pearson algorithm on a movie dataset."

    "title": "Blockbuster Culture's Next Rise or Fall: The Impact of Recommender Systems on Sales Diversity",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice-versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products.. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers\u2019 preferences."

    "abstract": "QoS-based Web service recommendation has recently gained much attention for providing a promising way to help users find high-quality services. To facilitate such recommendations, existing studies suggest the use of collaborative filtering techniques for personalized QoS prediction. These approaches, by leveraging partially observed QoS values from users, can achieve high accuracy of QoS predictions on the unobserved ones. However, the requirement to collect users' QoS data likely puts user privacy at risk, thus making them unwilling to contribute their usage data to a Web service recommender system. As a result, privacy becomes a critical challenge in developing practical Web service recommender systems. In this paper, we make the first attempt to cope with the privacy concerns for Web service recommendation. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective privacy-preserving framework by applying data obfuscation techniques, and further develop two representative privacy-preserving QoS prediction approaches under this framework. Evaluation results from a publicly-available QoS dataset of real-world Web services demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our privacy-preserving QoS prediction approaches. We believe our work can serve as a good starting point to inspire more research efforts on privacy-preserving Web service recommendation."

MOOCs are probably the most important \"novelty\" in the field of e-learning of the last years. MOOCs are capable of providing several ten thousands of learners with access to courses over the web. MOOCs have recently gained much attention especially in leading universities and are now often considered as a highly promising form of teaching. More and more universities are currently working to offer their courses in the form of MOOC providing learners with a wide variety of choices. With MOOCs proliferation, learners will be exposed to various challenges and the traditional problem in TEL \"finding the best learning resources\" is more than ever up to date. Since information retrieval and searching for the appropriate learning resources is an essential activity in TEL, the development of recommender systems for learning has seen increased attention. Recommender systems permit to respond to the traditional problem.

    "abstract": "The people who make algorithmic recommender systems want apparently incompatible things: they pride themselves on the scale at which their software works, but they also want to treat their materials and users with care. Care and scale are commonly understood as contradictory goals: to be careful is to work at small scale, while working at large scale requires abandoning the small concerns of care. Drawing together anthropological work on care and scale, this article analyzes how people who make music recommender systems try to reconcile these values, reimagining what care and scale mean and how they relate to each other in the process. It describes decorrelation, an ethical technique that metaphorically borrows from the mathematics of machine learning, which practitioners use to reimagine how values might relate with each other. This \u201cdecorrelative ethics\u201d facilitates new arrangements of care and scale, which challenge conventional anthropological theorizing."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been introduced to interactive recommender systems (IRS) because of its nature of learning from dynamic interactions and planning for long-run performance. As IRS is always with thousands of items to recommend (i.e., thousands of actions), most existing RL-based methods, however, fail to handle such a large discrete action space problem and thus become inefficient. The existing work that tries to deal with the large discrete action space problem by utilizing the deep deterministic policy gradient framework suffers from the inconsistency between the continuous action representation (the output of the actor network) and the real discrete action. To avoid such inconsistency and achieve high efficiency and recommendation effectiveness, in this paper, we propose a Tree-structured Policy Gradient Recommendation (TPGR) framework, where a balanced hierarchical clustering tree is built over the items and picking an item is formulated as seeking a path from the root to a certain leaf of the tree. Extensive experiments on carefully-designed environments based on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model provides superior recommendation performance and significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Pairwise learning-to-rank algorithms have been shown to allow recommender systems to leverage unary user feedback. We propose Multi-feedback Bayesian Personalized Ranking (MF-BPR), a pairwise method that exploits different types of feedback with an extended sampling method. The feedback types are drawn from different \"channels\", in which users interact with items (e.g., clicks, likes, listens, follows, and purchases). We build on the insight that different kinds of feedback, e.g., a click versus a like, reflect different levels of commitment or preference. Our approach differs from previous work in that it exploits multiple sources of feedback simultaneously during the training process. The novelty of MF-BPR is an extended sampling method that equates feedback sources with \"levels\" that reflect the expected contribution of the signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments carried out on three datasets containing multiple types of feedback. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a right sampling method, MF-BPR outperforms BPR in terms of accuracy. We find that the advantage of MF-BPR lies in its ability to leverage level information when sampling negative items."

The interface facilitates expressions of taste through simple graph interactions and these preferences are used to compute personalized, fully transparent item recommendations for a target user. Predictions are based on a collaborative analysis of preference data from a user's direct peer group on a social network. We find that in addition to receiving transparent and accurate item recommendations, users also learn a wealth of information about the preferences of their peers through interaction with our visualization. Such information is not easily discoverable in traditional text based interfaces. A detailed analysis of our design choices for visual layout, interaction and prediction techniques is presented. Our evaluations discuss results from a user study in which SmallWorlds was deployed as an interactive recommender system on Facebook."

    "abstract": "We provide here a list of 154 P450 genes and seven putative pseudogenes that have been characterized as of October 20, 1990. These genes have been described in a total of 23 eukaryotes (including nine mammalian and one plant species) and six prokaryotes. Of 27 gene families so far described, 10 exist in all mammals. These 10 families comprise 18 subfamilies, of which 16 and 14 have been mapped in the human and mouse genomes, respectively; to date, each subfamily appears to represent a cluster of tightly linked genes. We propose here a modest revision of the initially proposed (Nebert et al., DNA 6, 1\u201311,1987) and updated (Nebert et al., DNA 8, 1\u201313, 1989) nomenclature system based on evolution of the superfamily. For the gene we recommend that the italicized root symbol CYP for human (Cyp for mouse), representing cytochrome P450, be followed by an Arabic number denoting the family, a letter designating the subfamily (when two or more exist), and an Arabic numeral representing the individual gene within the subfamily. A hyphen should precede the final number in mouse genes. We suggest that the human nomenclature system be used for other species. This system is consistent with our earlier proposed nomenclature for P450 of all eukaryotes and prokaryotes, except that we are discouraging the future use of cumbersome Roman numerals."

Several algorithms have been proposed, which find important applications, like user profiling, recommender systems, web prefetching, design of adaptive web sites, etc. In all these applications the core issue is the developement of an effective prediction algorithm. In this paper, we focus on web-prefetching, because of its importance in reducing user perceived latency present in every Web-based application. The proposed method can be easily extended to the other aforementioned applications. Prefetching refers to the mechanism of deducing forthcoming page accesses of a client, based on access log information.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems try to provide people with recommendations of items they will appreciate, based on their past preferences, history of purchase, and demographic information. This chapter (1) introduces recommender systems, classifying them along four dimensions (i.e. the way the preferences are gathered, the used approach, the type of algorithm, and the way the results are provided) and describing recent work done in the area, and (2) provides more details about one such type of recommender systems, namely collaborative-recommendation systems. Such systems work by analyzing the items previously rated by all the users and are not based on the content of the items, as content-based systems."

    "title": "Rate it again",
    "abstract": "A common approach to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of asking users to explicitly rate items in order to collect feedback about their preferences. However, users have been shown to be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings.In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items."

    "title": "Fairness in Machine Learning: A Survey",
    "abstract": "As Machine Learning technologies become increasingly used in contexts that affect citizens, companies as well as researchers need to be confident that their application of these methods will not have unexpected social implications, such as bias towards gender, ethnicity, and/or people with disabilities. There is significant literature on approaches to mitigate bias and promote fairness, yet the area is complex and hard to penetrate for newcomers to the domain. This article seeks to provide an overview of the different schools of thought and approaches to mitigating (social) biases and increase fairness in the Machine Learning literature. It organises approaches into the widely accepted framework of pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing methods, subcategorizing into a further 11 method areas. Although much of the literature emphasizes binary classification, a discussion of fairness in regression, recommender systems, unsupervised learning, and natural language processing is also provided along with a selection of currently available open source libraries. The article concludes by summarising open challenges articulated as four dilemmas for fairness research."

    "title": "Mining Mobile User Preferences for Personalized Context-Aware Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in mobile devices and their sensing capabilities have enabled the collection of rich contextual information and mobile device usage records through the device logs. These context-rich logs open a venue for mining the personal preferences of mobile users under varying contexts and thus enabling the development of personalized context-aware recommendation and other related services, such as mobile online advertising. In this article, we illustrate how to extract personal context-aware preferences from the context-rich device logs, or context logs for short, and exploit these identified preferences for building personalized context-aware recommender systems. A critical challenge along this line is that the context log of each individual user may not contain sufficient data for mining his or her context-aware preferences. Therefore, we propose to first learn common context-aware preferences from the context logs of many users. Then, the preference of each user can be represented as a distribution of these common context-aware preferences. Specifically, we develop two approaches for mining common context-aware preferences based on two different assumptions, namely, context-independent and context-dependent assumptions, which can fit into different application scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that both approaches are effective and outperform baselines with respect to mining personal context-aware preferences for mobile users."

    "abstract": "Many data types arising from data mining applications can be modeled as bipartite graphs, examples include terms and documents in a text corpus, customers and purchasing items in market basket analysis and reviewers and movies in a movie recommender system. In this paper, the authors propose a new data clustering method based on partitioning the underlying biopartite graph. The partition is constructed by minimizing a normalized sum of edge weights between unmatched pairs of vertices of the bipartite graph. They show that an approximate solution to the minimization problem can be obtained by computing a partial singular value decomposition (SVD) of the associated edge weight matrix of the bipartite graph. They point out the connection of their clustering algorithm to correspondence analysis used in multivariate analysis. They also briefly discuss the issue of assigning data objects to multiple clusters. In the experimental results, they apply their clustering algorithm to the problem of document clustering to illustrate its effectiveness and efficiency."

    "title": "Cross Domain Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Cross domain recommender systems (CDRS) can assist recommendations in a target domain based on knowledge learned from a source domain. CDRS consists of three building blocks: domain, user-item overlap scenarios, and recommendation tasks. The objective of this research is to identify the most widely used CDRS building-block definitions, identify common features between them, classify current research in the frame of identified definitions, group together research with respect to algorithm types, present existing problems, and recommend future directions for CDRS research. To achieve this objective, we have conducted a systematic literature review of 94 shortlisted studies. We classified the selected studies using the tag-based approach and designed classification grids. Using classification grids, it was found that the category-domain contributed a maximum of 62%, whereas the time domain contributed at least 3%. User-item overlaps were found to have equal contribution. Single target domain recommendation task was found at a maximum of 78%, whereas cross-domain recommendation task had a minor influence at only 10%. MovieLens contributed the most at 22%, whereas Yahoo-music provided 1% between 29 datasets. Factorization-based algorithms contributed a total of 37%, whereas semantics-based algorithms contributed 6% among seven types of identified algorithm groups. Finally, future directions were grouped into five categories."

    "abstract": "We study fairness in collaborative-filtering recommender systems, which are sensitive to discrimination that exists in historical data. Biased data can lead collaborative-filtering methods to make unfair predictions for users from minority groups. We identify the insufficiency of existing fairness metrics and propose four new metrics that address different forms of unfairness. These fairness metrics can be optimized by adding fairness terms to the learning objective. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our new metrics can better measure fairness than the baseline, and that the fairness objectives effectively help reduce unfairness."

    "title": "Multilayer tensor factorization with applications to recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely adopted by electronic commerce and entertainment industries for individualized prediction and recommendation, which benefit consumers and improve business intelligence. In this article, we propose an innovative method, namely the recommendation engine of multilayers (REM), for tensor recommender systems. The proposed method utilizes the structure of a tensor response to integrate information from multiple modes, and creates an additional layer of nested latent factors to accommodate between-subjects dependency. One major advantage is that the proposed method is able to address the \"cold-start\" issue in the absence of information from new customers, new products or new contexts. Specifically, it provides more effective recommendations through sub-group information. To achieve scalable computation, we develop a new algorithm for the proposed method, which incorporates a maximum block improvement strategy into the cyclic blockwise-coordinate-descent algorithm. In theory, we investigate algorithmic properties for convergence from an arbitrary initial point and local convergence, along with the asymptotic consistency of estimated parameters. Finally, the proposed method is applied in simulations and IRI marketing data with 116 million observations of product sales. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing competitors in the literature."

    "abstract": "As an approach that applies not only to support user navigation on the Web, recommender systems have been built to assist and augment the natural social process of asking for recommendations from other people. In a typical recommender system, people provide suggestions as inputs, which the system aggregates and directs to appropriate recipients. In some cases, the primary computation is in the aggregation; in others, the value of the system lies in its ability to make good matches between the recommenders and those seeking recommendations.In this paper, we discuss the architectural and design features of WebMemex, a system that (a) provides recommended information based on the captured history of navigation from a list of people well-known to the users --- including the users themselves, (b) allows users to have access from any networked machine, (c) demands user authentication to access the repository of recommendations and (d) allows users to specify when the capture of their history should be performed."

    "title": "AIR: Attentional Intention-Aware Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "The capability of extracting sequential patterns from the user-item interaction data is now becoming a key feature of recommender systems. Though it is important to capture the sequential effect, existing methods only focus on modelling the sparse item-wise sequential effect in user preference and only consider the homogeneous user interaction behaviors (i.e., a single type of user behavior). As a result, the data sparsity issue inevitably arises and makes the learned sequential patterns fragile and unreliable, impeding the sequential recommendation performance of existing methods. Hence, in this paper, we propose AIR, namely attentional intention-aware recommender systems to predict category-wise future user intention and collectively exploit the rich heterogeneous user interaction behaviors (i.e., multiple types of user behaviors). In AIR, we propose to represent user intention as an action-category tuple to discover category-wise sequential patterns and to capture varied effect of different types of actions for recommendation. A novel attentional recurrent neural network (ARNN) is proposed to model the intention migration effect and infer users' future intention. Besides, an intention-aware factorization machine (ITFM) is developed to perform intention-aware sequential recommendation. Experiments on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superiority and practicality of AIR in sequential top-k recommendation tasks."

Simultaneously, recent concerns about so-called filter bubbles, misinformation and selective exposure are symptomatic of the disruptive potential of these digital news recommenders. Recommender systems can make or break filter bubbles, and as such can be instrumental in creating either a more closed or a more open internet. Current approaches to evaluating recommender systems are often focused on measuring an increase in user clicks and short-term engagement, rather than measuring the user's longer term interest in diverse and important information."

    "title": "AutoML for Deep Recommender Systems: A Survey",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a significant role in information filtering and have been utilized in different scenarios, such as e-commerce and social media. With the prosperity of deep learning, deep recommender systems show superior performance by capturing non-linear information and item-user relationships. However, the design of deep recommender systems heavily relies on human experiences and expert knowledge. To tackle this problem, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is introduced to automatically search for the proper candidates for different parts of deep recommender systems. This survey performs a comprehensive review of the literature in this field. Firstly, we propose an abstract concept for AutoML for deep recommender systems (AutoRecSys) that describes its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional AutoML techniques and recommender systems. Secondly, we present a taxonomy as a classification framework containing feature selection search, embedding dimension search, feature interaction search, model architecture search, and other components search. Furthermore, we put a particular emphasis on the search space and search strategy, as they are the common thread to connect all methods within each category and enable practitioners to analyze and compare various approaches. Finally, we propose four future promising research directions that will lead this line of research."

    "title": "A Collaborative Filtering based Recommender System for Suggesting New Trends in Any Domain of Research",
    "abstract": "Recommender system, an information filtering technology used in many items is presented in web sites as per the interest of users, and is implemented in applications like movies, music, venue, books, research articles, tourism and social media in general. In today's world, time has more value and the researchers have no much time to spend on searching for the right articles according to their research domain. More than 250 research paper recommender systems were published and the quantity of research papers published every day is increasing rapidly. Thus it needs an efficient searching and filtering mechanism to choose the quality research papers, so that the effort and time of researchers can be saved. The recommender system proposed here uses three major factors used for building this system which includes datasets, prediction rating based on users and cosine similarity. The ratings are made by user which will be determined by the number of accurate ratings they provide. The results are then sorted by using cosine similarity. We propose a research-paper recommender system using collaborative filtering approach to recommend a user with best research papers in their domain according to their queries and based on the similarities found from other users on the basis of their queries, which will help in avoiding time consuming searches for the user."

Moreover, existing federated recommenders need to fine-tune recommendation models in each device, which makes them hard to effectively exploit collaborative filtering (CF) information among users/devices."

    "title": "Improving recommendation accuracy based on item-specific tag preferences",
    "abstract": "In recent years, different proposals have been made to exploit Social Web tagging information to build more effective recommender systems. The tagging data, for example, were used to identify similar users or were viewed as additional information about the recommendable items. Recent research has indicated that \u201cattaching feelings to tags\u201d is experienced by users as a valuable means to express which features of an item they particularly like or dislike. When following such an approach, users would therefore not only add tags to an item as in usual Web 2.0 applications, but also attach a preference ( affect ) to the tag itself, expressing, for example, whether or not they liked a certain actor in a given movie. In this work, we show how this additional preference data can be exploited by a recommender system to make more accurate predictions. In contrast to previous work, which also relied on so-called tag preferences to enhance the predictive accuracy of recommender systems, we argue that tag preferences should be considered in the context of an item. We therefore propose new schemes to infer and exploit context-specific tag preferences in the recommendation process. An evaluation on two different datasets reveals that our approach is capable of providing more accurate recommendations than previous tag-based recommender algorithms and recent tag-agnostic matrix factorization techniques."

    "title": "Improved Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems based on collaborative filtering predi ct user preferences for products or services by learning past user- item relationships. A predominant approach to collaborative filte ring is neighborhood based (\u201ck-nearest neighbors), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. In this work, we enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to a substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called \u201cglobal effects from the data to make the different ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors. Unlike previous approaches where each interpolation weight is computed separately, simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors by globally solving a suitable optimization problem, also lea ding to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. The meth od was evaluated on the Netflix dataset. We could process the 2.8 mil lion queries of the Qualifying set in 10 minutes yielding a RMSE of 0.9086. Moreover, when an extensive training is allowed, such as SVD-factorization at the preprocessing stage, our method can produce results with a RMSE of 0.8982."

    "abstract": "Short search engine queries do not provide contextual information, making it difficult for traditional search engines to understand what users are really requesting. One approach to this problem is to use recommender systems that identify user interests through various methods in order to provide information specific to the user's needs. However, many current recommender systems use a collaborative model based on a network of users to provide the recommendations, leading to problems in environments where network relationships are sparse or unknown. Content-based recommenders can avoid the sparsity problem but they may be inefficient for large document collections. In this paper, we propose a concept-based recommender system that recommends papers to general users of the CiteSeerx digital library of Computer Science research publications. We also represent a novel way of classifying documents and creating user profiles based on the ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) classification tree. Based on these user profiles which are built using past click histories, relevant papers in the domain are recommended to users. Experiments with a set of users on the CiteSeerX database show that our concept-based method provides accurate recommendations even with limited user profile histories."

Although CDR has been extensively studied in recent years, there is a lack of a systematic review of the existing CDR approaches. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing CDR approaches, including challenges, research progress, and prospects. Specifically, we first summarize existing CDR approaches into four types, including single-target CDR, single-target multi-domain recommendation (MDR), dual-target CDR, and multi-target CDR. We then present the definitions and challenges of these CDR approaches. Next, we propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these approaches and report their research progress in detail. In the end, we share several promising prospects in CDR."

    "abstract": "For the last 25 years, organizations have invested heavily in information technology to support their work processes. In today's organizations, intra- and interorganizational work systems are increasingly IT-enabled. Available evidence, however, suggests the functional potential of these installed IT applications is underutilized. Most IT users apply a narrow band of features, operate at low levels of feature use, and rarely initiate extensions of the available features. We argue that organizations need aggressive tactics to encourage users to expand their use of installed IT-enabled work systems.\r\n\r\nThis article strives to accomplish three primary research objectives. First, we offer a comprehensive research model aimed both at coalescing existing research on post-adoptive IT use behaviors and at directing future research on those factors that influence users to (continuously) exploit and extend the functionality built into IT applications. Second, in developing this comprehensive research model, we provide a window (for researchers across a variety of scientific disciplines interested in technology management) into the rich body of research regarding IT adoption, use, and diffusion. Finally, we discuss implications and recommend guidelines for research and practice."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RS) have become an integral part of our daily life. However, most current RS often repeatedly recommend items to users with similar profiles. We argue that recommendation should be diversified by leveraging session contexts with personalized user profiles. For this, current session-based RS (SBRS) often assume a rigidly ordered sequence over data which does not fit in many real-world cases. Moreover, personalization is often omitted in current SBRS. Accordingly, a personalized SBRS over relaxedly ordered user-session contexts is more pragmatic. In doing so, deep-structured models tend to be too complex to serve for online SBRS owing to the large number of users and items. Therefore, we design an efficient SBRS with shallow wide-in-wide-out networks, inspired by the successful experience in modern language modelings. The experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods."

In reality, however, the input often is a sequence of various types of user-item interactions that are recorded over time and where we can have multiple data points per user-item pair. These sequential logs contain a variety of useful information that can be leveraged in the recommendation process, e.g., to predict the immediate next action of a user or to detect short-term trends in the community. In this tutorial we review what we call sequence-aware recommenders, i.e., approaches that aim to exploit the information in sequential interaction logs for a variety of different purposes. We in particular focus on sequential and session-based recommendation techniques and discuss algorithmic proposals as well as evaluation challenges."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are an important kind of learning systems, which can be achieved by latent-factor (LF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) with high efficiency and scalability. LF-based CF models rely on an optimization process with respect to some desired latent features; however, most of them employ first-order optimization algorithms, e.g., gradient decent schemes, to conduct their optimization task, thereby failing in discovering patterns reflected by higher order information. This work proposes to build a new LF-based CF model via second-order optimization to achieve higher accuracy. We first investigate a Hessian-free optimization framework, and employ its principle to avoid direct usage of the Hessian matrix by computing its product with an arbitrary vector. We then propose the Hessian-free optimization-based LF model, which is able to extract latent factors from the given incomplete matrices via a second-order optimization process. Compared with LF models based on first-order optimization algorithms, experimental results on two industrial datasets show that the proposed one can offer higher prediction accuracy with reasonable computational efficiency. Hence, it is a promising model for implementing high-performance recommenders."

Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL\u20106 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients. Elevated D\u2010Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life\u2010threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. So, COVID\u201019 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and an early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended.

However, while the majority of algorithms proposed in recommender systems literature have focused on improving recommendation accuracy (as exemplified by the recent Netflix Prize competition), other important aspects of recommendation quality, such as the diversity of recommendations, have often been overlooked. In this paper, we introduce a number of item re-ranking methods that can generate substantially more diverse recommendations across all users while maintaining comparable levels of recommendation accuracy. Empirical results consistently show the diversity gains of the proposed re-ranking methods for several real-world rating datasets and different rating prediction techniques."

In recent years, collaborative tagging systems with social bookmarking as their key component from the suite of Web 2.0 technologies allow users to freely bookmark and assign semantic descriptions to various shared resources on the web. While the list of favorite web pages indicates the interests or taste of each user, the assigned tags can further provide useful hints about what a user thinks of the pages."

In this paper, we investigated two factors thought to influence user trust towards a robot: preference elicitation (a combination of user involvement and explanation) and embodiment. We set our experiment in the application domain of a restaurant recommender system, assessing trust via user decision making and perceived source credibility. Previous research in this area uses simulated environments and recommender systems that present the user with the best choice from a pool of options. This experiment builds on past work in two ways: first, we strengthened the ecological validity of our experimental paradigm by incorporating perceived risk during decision making; and second, we used a system that recommends a nonoptimal choice to the user. While no effect of embodiment is found for trust, the inclusion of preference elicitation features significantly increases user trust towards the robot recommender system. These findings have implications for marketing and health promotion in relation to Human-Robot Interaction and call for further investigation into the development and maintenance of trust between robot and user."

    "title": "Promoting Cold-Start Items in Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "As one of the major challenges, cold-start problem plagues nearly all recommender systems. In particular, new items will be overlooked, impeding the development of new products online. Given limited resources, how to utilize the knowledge of recommender systems and design efficient marketing strategy for new items is extremely important. In this paper, we convert this ticklish issue into a clear mathematical problem based on a bipartite network representation. Under the most widely used algorithm in real e-commerce recommender systems, the so-called item-based collaborative filtering, we show that to simply push new items to active users is not a good strategy. Interestingly, experiments on real recommender systems indicate that to connect new items with some less active users will statistically yield better performance, namely, these new items will have more chance to appear in other users' recommendation lists. Further analysis suggests that the disassortative nature of recommender systems contributes to such observation. In a word, getting in-depth understanding on recommender systems could pave the way for the owners to popularize their cold-start products with low costs."

    "title": "Causal Inference for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "The task of recommender systems is classically framed as a prediction of users\u2019 preferences and users\u2019 ratings. However, its spirit is to answer a counterfactual question: \u201cWhat would the rating be if we \u2018forced\u2019 the user to watch the movie?\u201d This is a question about an intervention, that is a causal inference question. The key challenge of this causal inference is unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which items the users decide to interact with and how they rate them. To this end, we develop an algorithm that leverages classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Across simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to unobserved confounders and improves recommendation."

    "abstract": "Australia is falling behind other countries in performance and investment in higher education. Developed and developing countries alike accept there are strong links between their productivity and the proportion of the population with high-level skills. These countries have concluded that they must invest not only to encourage a major increase in the numbers of the population with degree-level qualifications but also to improve the quality of graduates. Australia is losing ground. Within the OECD we are now 9th out of 30 in the proportion of our population aged 25 to 34 years with such qualifications, down from 7th a decade ago. Twenty nine per cent of our 25- to 34-year-olds have degree-level qualifications but in other OECD countries targets of up to 50 per cent have already been set. These policy decisions elsewhere place us at a great competitive disadvantage unless immediate action is taken. This review was established to address the question of whether this critical sector of education is structured, organised and financed to position Australia to compete effectively in the new globalised economy. The panel has concluded that, while the system has great strengths, it faces significant, emerging threats which require decisive action. To address these, major reforms are recommended to the financing and regulatory frameworks for higher education."

    "abstract": "Given the rapid growth of participatory media content such as blogs, there is a need to design personalized recommender systems to recommend only useful content to users. We believe that in addition to producing useful recommendations, certain insights from media research such as simplification and opinion diversity in recommendations should form the foundations of such recommender systems, so that the behavior of the systems can be understood more closely, and modified if necessary. We propose and evaluate such a system based on a Bayesian user-model. We use the underlying social network of blog authors and readers to model the preference features for individual users. The initial results of our proposed solution are encouraging, and set the agenda for future research."

As it is said that everything has its pros and cons therefore, along with the expansion of domain comes information overload and difficulty in extraction of data. To overcome this problem the recommendation system plays a vital role. It is used to enhance the user experience by giving fast and coherent suggestions. This paper describes an approach which offers generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. Content-Based Recommender System is implemented using various deep learning approaches. This paper also gives an insight into problems which are faced in content-based recommendation system and we have made an effort to rectify them."

    "title": "Explainable Fashion Recommendation: A Semantic Attribute Region Guided Approach",
    "abstract": "In fashion recommender systems, each product usually consists of multiple semantic attributes (e.g., sleeves, collar, etc). When making cloth decisions, people usually show preferences for different semantic attributes (e.g., the clothes with v-neck collar). Nevertheless, most previous fashion recommendation models comprehend the clothing images with a global content representation and lack detailed understanding of users' semantic preferences, which usually leads to inferior recommendation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semantic Attribute Explainable Recommender System (SAERS). Specifically, we first introduce a fine-grained interpretable semantic space. We then develop a Semantic Extraction Network (SEN) and Fine-grained Preferences Attention (FPA) module to project users and items into this space, respectively. With SAERS, we are capable of not only providing cloth recommendations for users, but also explaining the reason why we recommend the cloth through intuitive visual attribute semantic highlights in a personalized manner. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

A personalized recommender system can help practitioners discover mass of medical knowledge hidden in history medical records to deal with information overload problem in prescription. To support practitioner's decision making in prescription, this paper proposes a framework of a hybrid recommender system which integrates artificial neural network and case-based reasoning. Three issues are considered in this system framework: (1) to define a patient's need by giving his/her symptom, (2) to mine features from free text in medical records and (3) to analyze temporal efficiency of drugs. The proposed recommender system is expected to help general practitioners to improve their efficiency and reduce risks of making errors in daily clinical consultation with patients."

    "title": "Customer Satisfaction of Recommender System: Examining Accuracy and Diversity in Several Types of Recommendation Approaches",
    "abstract": "Information technology and the popularity of mobile devices allow for various types of customer data, such as purchase history and behavior patterns, to be collected. As customer data accumulate, the demand for recommender systems that provide customized services to customers is growing. Global e-commerce companies offer recommender systems to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Research on recommender systems has consistently suggested that customer satisfaction will be highest when the recommendation algorithm is accurate and recommends a diversity of items. However, few studies have investigated the impact of accuracy and diversity on customer satisfaction. In this research, we seek to identify the factors determining customer satisfaction when using the recommender system. To this end, we develop several recommender systems and measure their ability to deliver accurate and diverse recommendations and their ability to generate customer satisfaction with diverse data sets. The results show that accuracy and diversity positively affect customer satisfaction when applying a deep learning-based recommender system. By contrast, only accuracy positively affects customer satisfaction when applying traditional recommender systems. These results imply that developers or managers of recommender systems need to identify factors that further improve customer satisfaction with the recommender system and promote the sustainable development of e-commerce."

We then discuss the challenges in building high-quality JRSs. One main challenge lies on the design of recommendation strategies since different job applicants may have different characteristics.

Personality traits are mainly measured by psychological questionnaires, and it is hard to obtain personality traits of large amount of users in real-world scenes.In this paper, we propose a new approach to automatically identify personality traits with Social Media contents in Chinese language environments. Social Media content features were extracted from 1766 Sina micro blog users, and the predicting model is trained with machine learning algorithms.The experimental results demonstrate that users' personality traits could be predicted from Social Media contents with acceptable Pearson Correlation, which makes it possible to develop user profiles for recommender system.

    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate prediction is an important task in recommender systems, which aims to estimate the probability of a user to click on a given item. Recently, many deep models have been proposed to learn low-order and high-order feature interactions from original features. However, since useful interactions are always sparse, it is difficult for DNN to learn them effectively under a large number of parameters. In real scenarios, artificial features are able to improve the performance of deep models (such as Wide & Deep Learning), but feature engineering is expensive and requires domain knowledge, making it impractical in different scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to augment feature space automatically. In this paper, We propose a novel Feature Generation by Convolutional Neural Network (FGCNN) model with two components: Feature Generation and Deep Classifier. Feature Generation leverages the strength of CNN to generate local patterns and recombine them to generate new features. Deep Classifier adopts the structure of IPNN to learn interactions from the augmented feature space. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets show that FGCNN significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art models. Moreover, when applying some state-of-the-art models as Deep Classifier, better performance is always achieved, showing the great compatibility of our FGCNN model. This work explores a novel direction for CTR predictions: it is quite useful to reduce the learning difficulties of DNN by automatically identifying important features."

    "abstract": "Due to the extensive growth of food varieties, making better and healthier food choices becomes more and more complex. Most of the current food suggestion applications offer just generic advices that are not tailored to the user's personal taste. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a novel food recommender system that provides high quality and personalized recipe suggestions. These recommendations are generated by leveraging a data set of users' preferences expressed in the form of users' ratings and tags, which signal the food's ingredients or features that the users like. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed recommendation technique significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have found that using tags in food recommendation algorithms can significantly increase the prediction accuracy, i.e., the match of the predicted preferences with the true user's preferred recipes. Furthermore, our user study shows that our system prototype is of high usability."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems provide users with content they might be interested in. Conventionally, recommender systems are evaluated mostly by using prediction accuracy metrics only. But, the ultimate goal of a recommender system is to increase user satisfaction. Therefore, evaluations that measure user satisfaction should also be performed before deploying a recommender system in a real target environment. Such evaluations are laborious and complicated compared to the traditional, data-centric evaluations, though. In this study, we carried out a user-centric evaluation of state-of-the-art recommender systems as well as a graph-based approach in the ecologically valid setting of an authentic social learning platform. We also conducted a data-centric evaluation on the same data to investigate the added value of user-centric evaluations and how user satisfaction of a recommender system is related to its performance in terms of accuracy metrics. Our findings suggest that user-centric evaluation results are not necessarily in line with data-centric evaluation results. We conclude that the traditional evaluation of recommender systems in terms of prediction accuracy only does not suffice to judge performance of recommender systems on the user side. Moreover, the user-centric evaluation provides valuable insights in how candidate algorithms perform on each of the five quality metrics for recommendations: usefulness, accuracy, novelty, diversity, and serendipity."

    "abstract": "Intuitionistic fuzzy recommender system (IFRS), which has been recently presented based on the theories of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and recommender systems, is an efficient tool for medical diagnosis. IFRS used the intuitionistic fuzzy similarity degree (IFSD) regarded as the generalization of the hard user-based, item-based and the rating-based similarity degrees in recommender systems to calculate the analogousness between patients in the system. In this paper, we firstly extend IFRS by using a new term - the intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) instead of the existing intuitionistic fuzzy matrix (IFM) in IFRS. Then, the intuitionistic value similarity measure (IvSM) and the intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM) are defined on the basis of the intuitionistic fuzzy vector. Some mathematical properties of these new terms are examined, and several IVSM functions are proposed. The performances of these IVSM functions for medical diagnosis are experimentally validated and compared with the existing similarity degrees of IFRS. The suggestion and recommendation of this paper involve the most efficient IVSM function(s) that should be used for medical diagnosis."

In this context, Collaborative Filtering (CF) persists as one of the most prominent strategies to effectively deal with large datasets and is capable of offering users interesting content in a recommendation fashion. Nevertheless, it is well\u2010known CF recommenders suffer from data sparsity, mainly in cold\u2010start scenarios, substantially reducing the quality of recommendations. In the vast literature about the aforementioned topic, there are numerous solutions, in which the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art contributions are, in some sense, conditioned or associated with traditional CF methods such as Matrix Factorization (MF), that is, they rely on linear optimization procedures to model users and items into low\u2010dimensional embeddings. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, there has been an increasing number of studies exploring deep learning techniques in the CF context for latent factor modelling. In this research, authors conduct a systematic review focusing on state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art literature on deep learning techniques applied in collaborative filtering recommendation, and also featuring primary studies related to mitigating the cold start problem.

    "title": "Modeling Multi-Purpose Sessions for Next-Item Recommendations via Mixture-Channel Purpose Routing Networks",
    "abstract": "A session-based recommender system (SBRS) suggests the next item by modeling the dependencies between items in a session. Most of existing SBRSs assume the items inside a session are associated with one (implicit) purpose. However, this may not always be true in reality, and a session may often consist of multiple subsets of items for different purposes (e.g., breakfast and decoration). Specifically, items (e.g., bread and milk) in a subsethave strong purpose-specific dependencies whereas items (e.g., bread and vase) from different subsets have much weaker or even no dependencies due to the difference of purposes. Therefore, we propose a mixture-channel model to accommodate the multi-purpose item subsets for more precisely representing a session. Filling gaps in existing SBRSs, this model recommends more diverse items to satisfy different purposes. Accordingly, we design effective mixture-channel purpose routing networks (MCPRN) with a purpose routing network to detect the purposes of each item and assign it into the corresponding channels. Moreover, a purpose specific recurrent network is devised to model the dependencies between items within each channel for a specific purpose. The experimental results show the superiority of MCPRN over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and diversity."

Notice that, besides the sensitive information of a specific rating score assigned to a certain item by a user, the information of a user's rated set of items shall also be well protected. Some very recent works propose to randomly sample some unrated items for each user and then assign some virtual ratings, so that the server can not identify the scores and the set of rated items easily during the server-client interactions. However, the virtual ratings assigned to the randomly sampled items will inevitably introduce some noise to the model training process, which will then cause loss in recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lossless federated recommendation method (FedRec++) by allocating some denoising clients (i.e., users) to eliminate the noise in a privacy-aware manner. We further analyse our FedRec++ in terms of security and losslessness, and discuss its generality in the context of existing works. Extensive empirical studies clearly show the effectiveness of our FedRec++ in providing accurate and privacy-aware recommendation without much additional communication cost."

Surgical management has evolved considerably during the last several decades. <h3>Objective</h3> To develop evidence-based guidelines to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective practice of parathyroidectomy. <h3>Evidence Review</h3> A multidisciplinary panel used PubMed to review the medical literature from January 1, 1985, to July 1, 2015. Levels of evidence were determined using the American College of Physicians grading system, and recommendations were discussed until consensus. <h3>Findings</h3> Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients, should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, and is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy. Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended for operative planning. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain surgical candidates. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery (minimally invasive parathyroidectomy) and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates. For minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring via a reliable protocol is recommended. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is not routinely recommended for known or suspected multigland disease. Ex vivo aspiration of resected parathyroid tissue may be used to confirm parathyroid tissue intraoperatively. Clinically relevant thyroid disease should be assessed preoperatively and managed during parathyroidectomy. Devascularized normal parathyroid tissue should be autotransplanted. Patients should be observed postoperatively for hematoma, evaluated for hypocalcemia and symptoms of hypocalcemia, and followed up to assess for cure defined as eucalcemia at more than 6 months. Calcium supplementation may be indicated postoperatively. Familial pHPT, reoperative parathyroidectomy, and parathyroid carcinoma are challenging entities that require special consideration and expertise. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Evidence-based recommendations were created to assist clinicians in the optimal treatment of patients with pHPT."

    "abstract": "This is a revision of guidelines, originally published in 2004, for the assessment of patients with neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system either at peripheral or central level. Screening questionnaires are suitable for identifying potential patients with neuropathic pain, but further validation of them is needed for epidemiological purposes. Clinical examination, including accurate sensory examination, is the basis of neuropathic pain diagnosis. For more accurate sensory profiling, quantitative sensory testing is recommended for selected cases in clinic, including the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathies and for research purposes. Measurement of trigeminal reflexes mediated by A-beta fibers can be used to differentiate symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia from classical trigeminal neuralgia. Measurement of laser-evoked potentials is useful for assessing function of the A-delta fiber pathways in patients with neuropathic pain. Functional brain imaging is not currently useful for individual patients in clinical practice, but is an interesting research tool. Skin biopsy to measure the intraepidermal nerve fiber density should be performed in patients with clinical signs of small fiber dysfunction. The intensity of pain and treatment effect (both in clinic and trials) should be assessed with numerical rating scale or visual analog scale. For future neuropathic pain trials, pain relief scales, patient and clinician global impression of change, the proportion of responders (50% and 30% pain relief), validated neuropathic pain quality measures and assessment of sleep, mood, functional capacity and quality of life are recommended."

    "title": "Improving Itinerary Recommendations for Tourists Through Metaheuristic Algorithms: An Optimization Proposal",
    "abstract": "In recent years, recommender systems have been used as a solution to support tourists with recommendations oriented to maximize the entertainment value of visiting a tourist destination. However, this is not an easy task because many aspects need to be considered to make realistic recommendations: the context of a tourist destination visited, lack of updated information about points of interest, transport information, weather forecast, etc. The recommendations concerning a tourist destination must be linked to the interests and constraints of the tourist. In this research, we present a mobile recommender system based on Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP)/Time Depending (TD) - Orienteering Problem (OP) - Time Windows (TW), which analyzes in real time the user's constraints and the points of interest's constraints. For solving TTDP, we clustered preferences depending on the number of days that a tourist will visit a tourist destination using a k-means algorithm. Then, with a genetic algorithm (GA), we optimize the proposed itineraries to tourists for facilitating the organization of their visits. We also used a parametrized fitness function to include any element of the context to generate an optimized recommendation. Our recommender is different from others because it is scalable and adaptable to environmental changes and users' interests, and it offers real-time recommendations. To test our recommender, we developed an application that uses our algorithm. Finally, 131 tourists used this recommender system and an analysis of users' perceptions was developed. Metrics were also used to detect the percentage of precision, in order to determine the degree of accuracy of the recommender system. This study has implications for researchers interested in developing software to recommend the best itinerary for tourists with constraint controls with regard to the optimized itineraries."

While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating their textual side information, these DNN-based methods still exhibit some limitations, such as difficulties in effectively understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization capabilities and reasoning skills. As a result, recent studies have actively attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, so as to provide researchers and practitioners in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting paradigms. More specifically, we first introduce the representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we systematically review the emerging advanced techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the promising future directions in this emerging field."

    "abstract": "We provide here a list of 221 P450 genes and 12 putative pseudogenes that have been characterized as of December 14, 1992. These genes have been described in 31 eukaryotes (including 11 mammalian and 3 plant species) and 11 prokaryotes. Of 36 gene families so far described, 12 families exist in all mammals examined to date. These 12 families comprise 22 mammalian subfamilies, of which 17 and 15 have been mapped in the human and mouse genome, respectively. To date, each subfamily appears to represent a cluster of tightly linked genes. This revision supersedes the previous updates [Nebert et al., DNA 6, 1\u201311, 1987; Nebert et al., DNA 8, 1\u201313, 1989; Nebert et al., DNA Cell Biol. 10, 1\u201314 (1991)] in which a nomenclature system, based on divergent evolution of the superfamily, has been described. For the gene and cDNA, we recommend that the italicized root symbol \"CYP\" for human (\"Cyp\" for mouse), representing \"cytochrome P450,\" be followed by an Arabic number denoting the family, a letter designating the subfamily (when two or more exist), and an Arabic numeral representing the individual gene within the subfamily. A hyphen should precede the final number in mouse genes. \"P\" (\"p\" in mouse) after the gene number denotes a pseudogene. If a gene is the sole member of a family, the subfamily letter and gene number need not be included. We suggest that the human nomenclature system be used for all species other than mouse. The mRNA and enzyme in all species (including mouse) should include all capital letters, without italics or hyphens. This nomenclature system is identical to that proposed in our 1991 update. Also included in this update is a listing of available data base accession numbers for P450 DNA and protein sequences. We also discuss the likelihood that this ancient gene superfamily has existed for more than 3.5 billion years, and that the rate of P450 gene evolution appears to be quite nonlinear. Finally, we describe P450 genes that have been detected by expressed sequence tags (ESTs), as well as the relationship between the P450 and the nitric oxide synthase gene superfamilies, as a likely example of convergent evolution."

    "abstract": "Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of current dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400-600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections."

    "title": "Towards more conversational and collaborative recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Current recommender systems, based on collaborative filtering, implement a rather limited model of interaction. These systems intelligently elicit information from a user only during the initial registration phase. Furthermore, users tend to collaborate only indirectly. We believe there are several unexplored opportunities in which information can be effectively elicited from users by making the underlying interaction model more conversational and collaborative. In this paper, we propose a set of techniques to intelligently select what information to elicit from the user in situations in which the user may be particularly motivated to provide such information. We argue that the resulting interaction improves the user experience. We conclude by reporting results of an offline experiment in which we compare the influence of different elicitation techniques on both the accuracy of the systems predictions and the users effort"

Community-based research paper sharing systems, such as CiteULike, have become popular among researchers. This paper proposes a framework for a tag-based research paper recommender system. The proposed approach exploits the use of sets of tags for recommending research papers to each user. The preliminary evaluation shows that user self-defined tags could be used as a profile for each individual user. This recommender system demonstrated an encouraging preliminary result with the overall accuracy percentage up to 91.66%."

    "title": "Adipokines: inflammation and the pleiotropic role of white adipose tissue",
    "abstract": "White adipose tissue is now recognised to be a multifunctional organ; in addition to the central role of lipid storage, it has a major endocrine function secreting several hormones, notably leptin and adiponectin, and a diverse range of other protein factors. These various protein signals have been given the collective name \u2018adipocytokines\u2019 or \u2018adipokines\u2019. However, since most are neither \u2018cytokines\u2019 nor \u2018cytokine-like\u2019, it is recommended that the term \u2018adipokine\u2019 be universally adopted to describe a protein that is secreted from (and synthesised by) adipocytes. It is suggested that the term is restricted to proteins secreted from adipocytes, excluding signals released only by the other cell types (such as macrophages) in adipose tissue. The adipokinome (which together with lipid moieties released, such as fatty acids and prostaglandins, constitute the secretome of fat cells) includes proteins involved in lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, the alternative complement system, vascular haemostasis, blood pressure regulation and angiogenesis, as well as the regulation of energy balance. In addition, there is a growing list of adipokines involved in inflammation (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, nerve growth factor) and the acute-phase response (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A). Production of these proteins by adipose tissue is increased in obesity, and raised circulating levels of several acute-phase proteins and inflammatory cytokines has led to the view that the obese are characterised by a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, and that this links causally to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. It is, however, unclear as to the extent to which adipose tissue contributes quantitatively to the elevated circulating levels of these factors in obesity and whether there is a generalised or local state of inflammation. The parsimonious view is that the increased production of inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins by adipose tissue in obesity relates primarily to localised events within the expanding fat depots. It is suggested that these events reflect hypoxia in parts of the growing adipose tissue mass in advance of angiogenesis, and involve the key controller of the cellular response to hypoxia, the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1."

    "title": "Temporal-Contextual Recommendation in Real-Time",
    "abstract": "Personalized real-time recommendation has had a profound impact on retail, media, entertainment and other industries. However, developing recommender systems for every use case is costly, time consuming and resource-intensive. To fill this gap, we present a black-box recommender system that can adapt to a diverse set of scenarios without the need for manual tuning. We build on techniques that go beyond simple matrix factorization to incorporate important new sources of information: the temporal order of events [Hidasi et al., 2015], contextual information to bootstrap cold-start users, metadata information about items [Rendle 2012] and the additional information surrounding each event. Additionally, we address two fundamental challenges when putting recommender systems in the real-world: how to efficiently train them with even millions of unique items and how to cope with changing item popularity trends [Wu et al., 2017]. We introduce a compact model, which we call hierarchical recurrent network with meta data (HRNN-meta) to address the real-time and diverse metadata needs; we further provide efficient training techniques via importance sampling that can scale to millions of items with little loss in performance. We report significant improvements on a wide range of real-world datasets and provide intuition into model capabilities with synthetic experiments. Parts of HRNN-meta have been deployed in production at scale for customers to use at Amazon Web Services and serves as the underlying recommender engine for thousands of websites."

    "title": "How does serendipity affect diversity in recommender systems? A serendipity-oriented greedy algorithm",
    "abstract": "Most recommender systems suggest items that are popular among all users and similar to items a user usually consumes. As a result, the user receives recommendations that she/he is already familiar with or would find anyway, leading to low satisfaction. To overcome this problem, a recommender system should suggest novel, relevant and unexpected i.e., serendipitous items. In this paper, we propose a serendipity-oriented, reranking algorithm called a serendipity-oriented greedy (SOG) algorithm, which improves serendipity of recommendations through feature diversification and helps overcome the overspecialization problem. To evaluate our algorithm, we employed the only publicly available dataset containing user feedback regarding serendipity. We compared our SOG algorithm with topic diversification, popularity baseline, singular value decomposition, serendipitous personalized ranking and Zheng\u2019s algorithms relying on the above dataset. SOG outperforms other algorithms in terms of serendipity and diversity. It also outperforms serendipity-oriented algorithms in terms of accuracy, but underperforms accuracy-oriented algorithms in terms of accuracy. We found that the increase of diversity can hurt accuracy and harm or improve serendipity depending on the size of diversity increase."

    "abstract": "New distribution channels like music streaming platforms paved way for making more and more diverse music available to users. Thus, music recommender systems got in the focus of research in academia as well as industry. Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems have been proven useful, but there is space left for improvements by adapting this general approach to better fit to the music recommendations problem. In this work, we incorporate context-based information about the music consumption into the recommendation process. This information is extracted from playlist names, which are analyzed and aggregated into so-called \"contextual clusters\". We find that the listening context plays an important role and thus allows for providing recommendations reaching precision values 33% higher than traditional approaches. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is a new method that extracts and integrates contextual information from playlist names into the recommendation process for improving music recommendations."

    "abstract": "Collaborative Recommender system helps the online users to identify the right product during electronic purchasing. The collaborative recommender system identifies the similar users based on the purchasing or rating behavior to the active user and then recommends the product based on the similar users. Collaborative recommender system is widely used in majority of the existing online recommender system such as orkut, google, amazon, walmart etc. Besides it popularity, is suffers due to sparsity, cold start and scalability recommender system. Extensive research is going on to overcome these problems. In this paper, Probabilistic neural network (PNN) is used to calculate the trust between users based on rating matrix. Using the calculated trust, sparse rating matrix is smoothened, by predicting the rating values of the nonrated items in the rating matrix. Using this smoothened rating matrix, the trust is calculated for online active users. The calculated trust is used to recommend product. Experiments are conducted using dataset such as movielens. Based on the performance metrics, it is proved that the proposed method performs better than the benchmark and some existing systems."

The residue number system is of particular interest because the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication may be executed in the same time as required for an addition operation. The main difficulty of the residue code relative to arithmetic operations is the determination of the relative magnitude of two numbers expressed in the residue code. The residue code is probably of little utility for general-purpose computation, but the code has many characteristics which recommend its use for special-purpose computations."

    "title": "Predicting Cancer Drug Response using a Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Abstract Motivation As we move toward an era of precision medicine, the ability to predict patient-specific drug responses in cancer based on molecular information such as gene expression data represents both an opportunity and a challenge. In particular, methods are needed that can accommodate the high-dimensionality of data to learn interpretable models capturing drug response mechanisms, as well as providing robust predictions across datasets. Results We propose a method based on ideas from \u2018recommender systems\u2019 (CaDRReS) that predicts cancer drug responses for unseen cell-lines/patients based on learning projections for drugs and cell-lines into a latent \u2018pharmacogenomic\u2019 space. Comparisons with other proposed approaches for this problem based on large public datasets (CCLE and GDSC) show that CaDRReS provides consistently good models and robust predictions even across unseen patient-derived cell-line datasets. Analysis of the pharmacogenomic spaces inferred by CaDRReS also suggests that they can be used to understand drug mechanisms, identify cellular subtypes and further characterize drug-pathway associations. Availability and implementation Source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/CSB5/CaDRReS. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    "title": "Temporal collaborative filtering with adaptive neighbourhoods",
    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering aims to predict user tastes, by minimising the mean error produced when predicting hidden user ratings. The aim of a deployed recommender system is to iteratively predict users' preferences over a dynamic, growing dataset, and system administrators are confronted with the problem of having to continuously tune the parameters calibrating their CF algorithm. In this work, we formalise CF as a time-dependent, iterative prediction problem. We then perform a temporal analysis of the Netflix dataset, and evaluate the temporal performance of two CF algorithms. We show that, due to the dynamic nature of the data, certain prediction methods that improve prediction accuracy on the Netflix probe set do not show similar improvements over a set of iterative train-test experiments with growing data. We then address the problem of parameter selection and update, and propose a method to automatically assign and update per-user neighbourhood sizes that (on the temporal scale) outperforms setting global parameters."

    "title": "A New Recommender System for 3D E-Commerce: An EEG Based Approach",
    "abstract": "This position paper discusses a novel recommender system for e-commerce in virtual reality environments. The system provides recommendations by taking into account prepurchase ratings in addition to traditional postpurchase ratings. Users' positive emotions are captured in the form of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals while interacting with 3D virtual products prior to purchase. The prepurchase ratings are calculated from the averaged relative power of the collected EEG signals. Prepurchase ratings are complementary to postpurchase ratings and help in alleviating two severe issues that traditional recommender systems suffer from: data sparsity and cold start. By making proper use of both pre- and postpurchase ratings, user preference can be modeled more accurately. This will improve the effectiveness of the current recommender systems and may change the traditional e- business applications. \uf020"

In this method, the optimistic exponential type of ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator is applied to fuse the output of five recommender system strategies. Experiments using MovieLens dataset show the superiority of the proposed hybrid approach in the cold-start conditions."

In particular, the current infrastructures for the development of personalized, ubiquitous services are not flexible enough to accommodate the configuration requirements of the various application domains. To address such issues, highly configurable infrastructures are needed.In this article, we describe Seta2000, an infrastructure for the development of recommender systems that support personalized interactions with their users and are accessible from different types of devices (e.g., desktop computers and mobile phones). The Seta2000 infrastructure offers a built-in recommendation engine, based on a multi-agent architecture. Moreover, the infrastructure supports the integration of heterogeneous software and the development of agents that can be configured to offer specialized facilities within a recommender system, but also to dynamically enable and disable such facilities, depending on the requirements of the application domain. The Seta2000 infrastructure has been exploited to develop two prototypes: SeTA is an adaptive Web store personalizing the recommendation and presentation of products in the Web. INTRIGUE is a personalized, ubiquitous information system suggesting attractions to possibly heterogeneous tourist groups."

    "title": "Exploiting the diversity of user preferences for recommendation",
    "abstract": "Diversity as a quality dimension for Recommender Systems has been receiving increasing attention in the last few years. This has been paralleled by an intense strand of research on diversity in search tasks, and in fact converging views on diversity theories and techniques from Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems have been put forward in recent work. In this paper we research diversity not only as a target property for a recommender system, but as an element in the input data, within and between user behaviors, that a recommender system can leverage to enhance the quality of its output in terms of the balance between accuracy and diversity. We propose an adaptation of search result diversification methods to recommender systems based on query reformulation: we identify the diversity within user profiles and generate partial recommendations based on homogeneous subsets of user preferences (sub-profiles), which we combine later to produce a final recommendation. We report experiments on movie and music recommendation datasets showing that our approach improves indeed the quality of state-of-the-art recommenders, and is competitive against diversification methods that use explicitly item categories as the units for diversification. Our approach shows further advantages in cases where the high cardinality of the explicit category spaces can pose a problem in terms of computational cost."

Context-aware recommendations are thus critical to improve both quality and explainability of recommender systems, compared to traditional recommendations that are solely based on user-item interactions. Tensor factorization machines have achieved the state-of-the-art performance due to their capability of integrating users, items, and contextual factors in one unify way. However, few work has focused on the robustness of a context-aware recommender system. Improving the robustness of a tensor-based model is challenging due to the sparsity of the observed tensor and the multi-linear nature of tensor factorization. In this paper, we propose ATF, a model that combines tensor factorization and adversarial learning for context-aware recommendations. Doing so allows us to reap the benefits of tensor factorization, while enhancing the robustness of a recommender model, and thus improves its eventual performance. Empirical studies on two real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms standard tensor-based methods."

However, traditional recommender systems continue to face great challenges such as poor interactivity and explainability, which actually also hinder their broad deployment in real-world systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender System) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Chat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and establishing connections between users and products through in-context learning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and explainable. What's more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user's preferences can transfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and prompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start scenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the results of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating prediction task. Chat-Rec offers a novel approach to improving recommender systems and presents new practical scenarios for the implementation of AIGC (AI generated content) in recommender system studies."

In developing this concept, we review a number of the physical and chemical properties of PEG and aqueous solutions of PEG in the context of recent applications to chemical reaction engineering. Thus, we cover the interesting physical properties of PEG solutions in water, their unique solvent properties, and finally the metal cation coordination ability of PEG solutions. These properties are important in the application of low molecular weight liquid PEG as a solvent in chemical reactions; in the use of PEG as an alternative phase-transfer catalyst (PTC); and in the application of ABRE in the development of alternative pulping processes, catalytic chemistry, and enzymatic catalysis."

Where the literature is poor, we have taken into consideration the collective experience of the group.We recommend drug concentration for skin testing aiming to achieve a specificity of at least 95%. It has been possible to recommend specific drug concentration for betalactam antibiotics, perioperative drugs, heparins, platinum salts and radiocontrast media. For many other drugs, there is insufficient evidence to recommend appropriate drug concentration.

The basic idea of cognitive load theory is that cognitive capacity in working memory is limited, so that if a learning task requires too much capacity, learning will be hampered. The recommended remedy is to design instructional systems that optimize the use of working memory capacity and avoid cognitive overload. Cognitive load theory has advanced educational research considerably and has been used to explain a large set of experimental findings. This article sets out to explore the open questions and the boundaries of cognitive load theory by identifying a number of problematic conceptual, methodological and application-related issues. It concludes by presenting a research agenda for future studies of cognitive load."

    "title": "Two Birds One Stone",
    "abstract": "The number of \"hits\" has been widely regarded as the lifeblood of many web systems, e.g., e-commerce systems, advertising systems and multimedia consumption systems. However, users would not hit an item if they cannot see it, or they are not interested in the item. Recommender system plays a critical role of discovering interested items from near-infinite inventory and exhibiting them to potential users. Yet, two issues are crippling the recommender systems. One is \"how to handle new users\", and the other is \"how to surprise users\". The former is well-known as cold-start recommendation, and the latter can be investigated as long-tail recommendation. This paper, for the first time, proposes a novel approach which can simultaneously handle both cold-start and long-tail recommendation in a unified objective."

    "abstract": "Abstract Reproducibility is a key requirement for scientific progress. It allows the reproduction of the works of others, and, as a consequence, to fully trust the reported claims and results. In this work, we argue that, by facilitating reproducibility of recommender systems experimentation, we indirectly address the issues of accountability and transparency in recommender systems research from the perspectives of practitioners, designers, and engineers aiming to assess the capabilities of published research works. These issues have become increasingly prevalent in recent literature. Reasons for this include societal movements around intelligent systems and artificial intelligence striving toward fair and objective use of human behavioral data (as in Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, or Human\u2013Computer Interaction). Society has grown to expect explanations and transparency standards regarding the underlying algorithms making automated decisions for and around us. This work surveys existing definitions of these concepts and proposes a coherent terminology for recommender systems research, with the goal to connect reproducibility to accountability. We achieve this by introducing several guidelines and steps that lead to reproducible and, hence, accountable experimental workflows and research. We additionally analyze several instantiations of recommender system implementations available in the literature and discuss the extent to which they fit in the introduced framework. With this work, we aim to shed light on this important problem and facilitate progress in the field by increasing the accountability of research."

    "title": "Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Building a successful recommender system depends on understanding both the dimensions of people's preferences as well as their dynamics. In certain domains, such as fashion, modeling such preferences can be incredibly difficult, due to the need to simultaneously model the visual appearance of products as well as their evolution over time. The subtle semantics and non-linear dynamics of fashion evolution raise unique challenges especially considering the sparsity and large scale of the underlying datasets. In this paper we build novel models for the One-Class Collaborative Filtering setting, where our goal is to estimate users' fashion-aware personalized ranking functions based on their past feedback. To uncover the complex and evolving visual factors that people consider when evaluating products, our method combines high-level visual features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, users' past feedback, as well as evolving trends within the community. Experimentally we evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets from this http URL, where we show it to outperform state-of-the-art personalized ranking measures, and also use it to visualize the high-level fashion trends across the 11-year span of our dataset."

    "title": "Addressing the Item Cold-Start Problem by Attribute-Driven Active Learning",
    "abstract": "In recommender systems, cold-start issues are situations where no previous events, e.g., ratings, are known for certain users or items. In this paper, we focus on the item cold-start problem. Both content information (e.g., item attributes) and initial user ratings are valuable for seizing users' preferences on a new item. However, previous methods for the item cold-start problem either (1) incorporate content information into collaborative filtering to perform hybrid recommendation, or (2) actively select users to rate the new item without considering content information and then do collaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation scheme for the item cold-start problem by leveraging both active learning and items' attribute information. Specifically, we design useful user selection criteria based on items' attributes and users' rating history, and combine the criteria in an optimization framework for selecting users. By exploiting the feedback ratings, users' previous ratings and items' attributes, we then generate accurate rating predictions for the other unselected users. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method over traditional methods."

These techniques involve off-line analysis using evaluation methods from machine learning and information retrieval. We argue that while off-line analysis is useful, user satisfaction with a recommendation strategy can only be measured in an on-line context. We propose a new evaluation framework which involves a paired test of two recommender systems which simultaneously compete to give the best recommendations to the same user at the same time. The user interface and the interaction model for each system is the same. The framework enables you to specify an API so that different recommendation strategies may take part in such a competition. The API defines issues such as access to data, the interaction model and the means of gathering positive feedback from the user. In this way it is possible to obtain a relative measure of user satisfaction with the two systems."

    "title": "Deep Adversarial Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed rapid developments on social recommendation techniques for improving the performance of recommender systems due to the growing influence of social networks to our daily life. The majority of existing social recommendation methods unify user representation for the user-item interactions (item domain) and user-user connections (social domain). However, it may restrain user representation learning in each respective domain, since users behave and interact differently in the two domains, which makes their representations to be heterogeneous. In addition, most of traditional recommender systems can not efficiently optimize these objectives, since they utilize negative sampling technique which is unable to provide enough informative guidance towards the training during the optimization process. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel deep adversarial social recommendation framework DASO. It adopts a bidirectional mapping method to transfer users' information between social domain and item domain using adversarial learning. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

This paper suggests another information source, item taxonomies, in addition to item preference data for assisting recommendation making. Item taxonomy information has been popularly applied in diverse ecommerce domains for product or content classification, and therefore can be easily obtained and adapted by recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the implicit relations between users' item preferences and taxonomic preferences, suggest and verify that users who share similar item preferences may also share similar taxonomic preferences. Under this assumption, a novel recommendation technique is proposed that combines the users' item preferences and the additional taxonomic preferences together to make better quality recommendations as well as alleviate the cold-start problem. Empirical evaluations to this approach are conducted and the results show that the proposed technique outperforms other existing techniques in both recommendation quality and computation efficiency."

Constraint satisfaction filtering is adopted to profile a tourist\u2019s needs and circumstances. For this purpose, this research modifies the existing constraint satisfaction method to an approximate constraint satisfaction filtering method that incorporates indifference intervals into constraints.

This system integrates emotional fashion themes and human perception on personalized body shapes and professional designers' knowledge. The corresponding perceptual data are systematically collected from professional using sensory evaluation techniques. The perceptual data of consumers and designers are formalized mathematically using fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations. The complex relation between human body measurements and basic sensory descriptors, provided by designers, is modeled using fuzzy decision trees. The fuzzy decision trees constitute an empirical model based on learning data measured and evaluated on a set of representative samples. The complex relation between basic sensory descriptors and fashion themes, given by consumers, is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps. The combination of the two models can provide more complete information to the fashion recommender system, making it possible to evaluate if a specific body shape is relevant to a desired emotional fashion theme and which garment design scheme can improve the image of the body shape. The proposed system has been validated in a customized design and mass market selection through the evaluations of target consumers and fashion experts using a method frequently used in marketing study."

We evaluated the renoprotective effects of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by adding treatment with aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor, to treatment with the maximal recommended dose of losartan (100 mg daily) and optimal antihypertensive therapy in patients who had hypertension and type 2 diabetes with nephropathy.We enrolled 599 patients in this multinational, randomized, double-blind study. After a 3-month, open-label, run-in period during which patients received 100 mg of losartan daily, patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of treatment with aliskiren (150 mg daily for 3 months, followed by an increase in dosage to 300 mg daily for another 3 months) or placebo, in addition to losartan. The primary outcome was a reduction in the ratio of albumin to creatinine, as measured in an early-morning urine sample, at 6 months.The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Treatment with 300 mg of aliskiren daily, as compared with placebo, reduced the mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio by 20% (95% confidence interval, 9 to 30; P<0.001), with a reduction of 50% or more in 24.7% of the patients who received aliskiren as compared with 12.5% of those who received placebo (P<0.001). A small difference in blood pressure was seen between the treatment groups by the end of the study period (systolic, 2 mm Hg lower [P=0.07] and diastolic, 1 mm Hg lower [P=0.08] in the aliskiren group). The total numbers of adverse and serious adverse events were similar in the groups.Aliskiren may have renoprotective effects that are independent of its blood-pressure-lowering effect in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and nephropathy who are receiving the recommended renoprotective treatment.

Conversational recommenders guide a user through a sequence of iterations, suggesting specific items, and using feedback from users to refine their suggestions in subsequent iterations. Different recommender systems look for different types of feedback from users. In this paper we examine the role of critiquing, a form of feedback in which the user indicates a preference over a particular feature of a recommended item. For example, when shopping for a PC a user might indicate that they like the current suggestion but they are looking for something cheaper; cheaper is a critique over the price feature of the PC case. Sometimes it is useful to critique multiple features simultaneously (compound critiques). In this paper we describe how a recommender can automatically discover useful compound critiques during the recommendation session and how these critiques can be used to improve recommendation efficiency."

By leveraging the knowledge from relevant domains, the cross-domain recommendation technique can be an effective way of alleviating the data sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-directional Transfer learning method for cross-domain recommendation by using Graph Collaborative Filtering network as the base model (BiTGCF). BiTGCF not only exploits the high-order connectivity in user-item graph of single domain through a novel feature propagation layer, but also realizes the two-way transfer of knowledge across two domains by using the common user as the bridge. Moreover, distinct from previous cross-domain collaborative filtering methods, BiTGCF fuses users' common features and domain-specific features during transfer. Experimental results on four couple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of BiTGCF over state-of-the-art models in terms of bi-directional cross domain recommendation."

While recommender systems have been widely studied, this is mostly in relation to leisure products (e.g. movies, books and music) with non-repeated purchases. In grocery shopping, however, consumers will make multiple purchases of the same or very similar products more frequently than buying entirely new items. The proposed recommendation scheme offers several advantages in addressing the grocery shopping problem, namely: 1) a product similarity measure that suits a domain where no rating information is available; 2) a basket sensitive random walk model to approximate product similarities by exploiting incomplete neighborhood information; 3) online adaptation of the recommendation based on the current basket and 4) a new performance measure focusing on products that customers have not purchased before or purchase infrequently. Empirical results benchmarking on three real-world data sets demonstrate a performance improvement of the proposed method over other existing collaborative filtering models."

    "abstract": "Providing accurate recommendations to newly joined users (or potential users, so-called cold-start users) has remained a challenging yet important problem in recommender systems. To infer the preferences of such cold-start users based on their preferences observed in other domains, several cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods have been studied. The state-of-the-art Embedding and Mapping approach for CDR (EMCDR) aims to infer the latent vectors of cold-start users by supervised mapping from the latent space of another domain. In this paper, we propose a novel CDR framework based on semi-supervised mapping, called SSCDR, which effectively learns the cross-domain relationship even in the case that only a few number of labeled data is available. To this end, it first learns the latent vectors of users and items for each domain so that their interactions are represented by the distances, then trains a cross-domain mapping function to encode such distance information by exploiting both overlapping users as labeled data and all the items as unlabeled data. In addition, SSCDR adopts an effective inference technique that predicts the latent vectors of cold-start users by aggregating their neighborhood information. Our extensive experiments on different CDR scenarios show that SSCDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of CDR accuracy, particularly in the realistic settings that a small portion of users overlap between two domains."

Due to the paucity of preference data per reviewer or per paper (relative to other recommender systems applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to learn reviewer-paper preference models. Our models are evaluated not just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of end-assignment quality. Using a linear programming-based assignment optimization, we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to maximize the overall affinities of papers assigned to reviewers. We demonstrate our results on real reviewer bidding data from the IEEE ICDM 2007 conference."

This practice however raises serious privacy concerns regarding the recommender\u2019s collection and handling of potentially sensitive data. Several privacy-aware recommender systems have been proposed in recent literature, but comparatively little attention has been given to systems at the intersection of implicit feedback and privacy. To address this shortcoming, we propose a practical federated recommender system for implicit data under user-level local differential privacy (LDP). The privacy-utility trade-off is controlled by parameters \u03f5 and k, regulating the per-update privacy budget and the number of \u03f5-LDP gradient updates sent by each user, respectively. To further protect the user\u2019s privacy, we introduce a proxy network to reduce the fingerprinting surface by anonymizing and shuffling the reports before forwarding them to the recommender. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the MovieLens dataset, achieving up to Hit Ratio with K=10 ([email protected]) 0.68 on 50,000 users with 5,000 items. Even on the full dataset, we show that it is possible to achieve reasonable utility with [email protected]>0.5 without compromising user privacy."

The local utility captures users' mutual preferences, whereas the global utility manages the overall quality of the entire reciprocal network. Extensive empirical evaluation on two real-world data sets (online dating and online recruiting) demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with existing recommendation algorithms.

A key development challenge along this line is how to track user interests dynamically. To this end, we first define four types of interest patterns to understand users' rating behaviors and analyze the properties of these patterns. We also propose a rating graph and rating chain based approach for detecting these interest patterns. For each users' rating series, a rating graph and a rating chain are constructed based on the similarities between rated items. The type of a given user's interest pattern is identified through the density of the corresponding rating graph and the continuity of the corresponding rating chain. In addition, we propose a general algorithm framework for improving recommender systems by exploiting these identified patterns. Finally, experimental results on a real-world data set show that the proposed rating graph based approach is effective for detecting user interest patterns, which in turn help to improve the performance of recommender systems."

The essential health factor is considered to be personal lifestyle, with the help of a critical examination of various disciplines. Integrating the recommender system effectively contributes to the prevention of disease, and it also leads to a reduction in treatment cost, which contributes to an improvement in the quality of life. At the same time, there exist various challenges within the recommender system, mainly cold start and scalability. To effectively address the inefficiencies, we propose combined hybrid methods in regard to machine learning. The primary aim of this learning method is to integrate the most effective and efficient learning algorithms to examine how combined hybrid filtering can help to improve the cold star problem efficiently in the provision of personalized well-being in regard to health food service. These methods include: (1) switching among content-based and collaborative filtering; (2) identifying the user context with the integration of dynamic filtering; and (3) learning the profiles with the help of processing and screening of reflecting feedback loops. The experimental results were evaluated by using three absolute error measures, providing comparable results with other studies relative to machine learning domains. The effects of using the hybrid learning method are gathered with the help of the experimental results. Our experiments also show that the hybrid method improves accuracy by 14.61% of the average error predicted in the recommender systems in comparison to the collaborative methods, which mainly focus on the computation of similar entities."

Furthermore, it incorporates an optimization-based stage for generating a daily meal plan whose goal is the recommendation of food highly preferred by the user, not consumed recently, and satisfying his/her daily nutritional requirements. A case study is developed for testing the performance of the recommender system."

    "title": "Yield gap analysis with local to global relevance\u2014A review",
    "abstract": "Yields of crops must increase substantially over the coming decades to keep pace with global food demand driven by population and income growth. Ultimately global food production capacity will be limited by the amount of land and water resources available and suitable for crop production, and by biophysical limits on crop growth. Quantifying food production capacity on every hectare of current farmland in a consistent and transparent manner is needed to inform decisions on policy, research, development and investment that aim to affect future crop yield and land use, and to inform on-ground action by local farmers through their knowledge networks. Crop production capacity can be evaluated by estimating potential yield and water-limited yield levels as benchmarks for crop production under, respectively, irrigated and rainfed conditions. The differences between these theoretical yield levels and actual farmers' yields define the yield gaps, and precise spatially explicit knowledge about these yield gaps is essential to guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. This paper reviews methods to estimate yield gaps, with a focus on the local-to-global relevance of outcomes. Empirical methods estimate yield potential from 90 to 95th percentiles of farmers' yields, maximum yields from experiment stations, growers' yield contests or boundary functions; these are compared with crop simulation of potential or water-limited yields. Comparisons utilize detailed data sets from western Kenya, Nebraska (USA) and Victoria (Australia). We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield gap assessment and compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska, Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components for a yield gap assessment that can be applied at local to global scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and experiments."

    "title": "Top-N Recommendation for Shared Accounts",
    "abstract": "Standard collaborative filtering recommender systems assume that every account in the training data represents a single user. However, multiple users often share a single account. A typical example is a single shopping account for the whole family. Traditional recommender systems fail in this situation. If contextual information is available, context aware recommender systems are the state-of-the-art solution. Yet, often no contextual information is available. Therefore, we introduce the challenge of recommending to shared accounts in the absence of contextual information. We propose a solution to this challenge for all cases in which the reference recommender system is an item-based top-N collaborative filtering recommender system, generating recommendations based on binary, positive-only feedback. We experimentally show the advantages of our proposed solution for tackling the problems that arise from the existence of shared accounts on multiple datasets."

Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics. We show how the hybridization of CB+CF systems and the integration of interest diversity features are important to improve predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using precision and recall measures."

To pursue high model fidelity, it is usually desirable to retrain the model on both historical and new data, since it can account for both long-term and short-term user preference. However, a full model retraining could be very time-consuming and memory-costly, especially when the scale of historical data is large. In this work, we study the model retraining mechanism for recommender systems, a topic of high practical values but has been relatively little explored in the research community."

That report of two years ago urged Americans to view mental health as paramount to personal well-being, family relationships, and successful contributions to society. It documented the disabling nature of mental illnesses, showcased the strong science base behind effective treatments, and recommended that people seek help for mental health problems or disorders. The first mental health report also acknowledged that all Americans do not share equally in the hope for recovery from mental illnesses. This is especially true of members of racial and ethnic minority groups. That awareness galvanized me to ask for a supplemental report on the nature and extent of disparities in mental health care for racial and ethnic minorities and on promising directions for the elimination of these disparities. This Supplement documents that the science base on racial and ethnic minority mental health is inadequate; the best available research, however, indicates that these groups have less access to and avail-ability of care, and tend to receive poorer quality mental health services. These disparities leave minority communities with a greater disability burden from unmet mental health needs. A hallmark of this Supplement is its emphasis on the role that cultural factors play in mental health. The cultures from which people hail affect all aspects of mental health and illness, including the types of stresses they confront, whether they seek help, what types of help they seek, what symptoms and concerns they bring to clinical attention, and what types of coping styles and social supports they possess. Likewise, the cultures of clinicians and service systems influence the nature of mental health services."

    "title": "On Recommendation of Learning Objects Using Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model",
    "abstract": "The e-learning recommender system in learning institutions is increasingly becoming the preferred mode of delivery, as it enables learning anytime, anywhere. However, delivering personalised course learning objects based on student's preferences is still a challenge. Current mainstream recommendation algorithms, such as the Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF), deal with only two types of entities, namely users and items with their ratings. However, these methods do not pay attention to student's preferences, such as learning styles, which are especially important for the accuracy of course learning objects prediction or recommendation. Moreover, several recommendation techniques experience cold-start and rating sparsity problems. To address the challenge of improving the quality of recommender systems, in this paper a novel recommender algorithm for machine learning is proposed, which combines students actual rating with their learning styles to recommend personalised course learning objects (LOs). Various recommendation techniques are considered in an experimental study investigating the best technique to use in predicting student ratings for e-learning recommender systems. We use the Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) to represent both the student learning styles and the learning object profiles. The predicted ratings are compared with the actual student ratings to determine the accuracy of the recommendation techniques, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics. This approach has been experimented on 80 students for an online course created in the MOODLE Learning Management System. The results of the experiment show that the best recommendation technique is our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm that combines the collaborative filtering and the content-based filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of the predictions, and solves the cold-start and the rating sparsity problems using the FSLSM representations of the student learning styles and the learning object profiles."

For the probabilistic neighborhood selection phase, we use an efficient method for weighted sampling of k neighbors that takes into consideration the similarity levels between the target user (or item) and the candidate neighbors. We conduct an empirical study showing that the proposed method increases the coverage, dispersion, and diversity reinforcement of recommendations by selecting diverse sets of representative neighbors. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms popular methods in terms of item prediction accuracy, utility-based ranking, and other popular measures, across various experimental settings. This performance improvement is in accordance with ensemble learning theory and the phenomenon of \"hubness\" in recommender systems."

The conclusions regarding terminology and morphologic criteria from the NCI meeting led to the Bethesda Thyroid Atlas Project and form the framework for the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Design: Participants of the Atlas Project were selected from among the committee members of the NCI FNA State of the Science Conference and other participants at the live conference. The terminology framework was based on a literature search of English language publications dating back to 1995 using PubMed as the search engine; online forum discussions (http://thyroidfna.cancer.gov/forums/default.aspx); and formal interdisciplinary discussions held on October 22 and 23, 2007, in Bethesda, MD. Main Outcome: For clarity of communication, the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology recommends that each report begin with one of the six general diagnostic categories. Each of the categories has an implied cancer risk that links it to an appropriate clinical management guideline. Conclusions: The project participants hope that the adoption of this framework will facilitate communication among cytopathologists, endocrinologists, surgeons, and radiologists; facilitate cytologic\u2013histologic correlation for thyroid diseases; facilitate research into the understanding of thyroid diseases; and allow easy and reliable sharing of data from different laboratories for national and international collaborative studies."

However, this platform faces many challenges, such as the increasing amount of data, the diversity of pedagogical resources and a large number of learners that makes harder to find what the learners are really looking for. Furthermore, most of the students in this platform are new graduates who have just come to integrate higher education and who need a system to help them to take the relevant courses that take into account the requirements and needs of each learner. In this article, we develop a distributed courses recommender system for the e-learning platform. It aims to discover relationships between student\u2019s activities using association rules method in order to help the student to choose the most appropriate learning materials. We also focus on the analysis of past historical data of the courses enrollments or log data. The article discusses particularly the frequent itemsets concept to determine the interesting rules in the transaction database. Then, we use the extracted rules to find the catalog of more suitable courses according to the learner\u2019s behaviors and preferences. Next, we deploy our recommender system using big data technologies and techniques. Especially, we implement parallel FP-growth algorithm provided by Spark Framework and Hadoop ecosystem. The experimental results show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed system. Finally, we evaluate the performance of Spark MLlib library compared to traditional machine learning tools including Weka and R."

The social network and the social context are two vital elements in social recommender systems. In this contribution, we propose a new framework for a social recommender system based on both network structure analysis and social context mining. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are able to capture and simulate the complex structure of a micro-blog network. We derive the prediction formula from ERGMs for recommending micro-blog users. Then, a primary recommendation list is created by analysing the micro-blog network structure. In the next step, we calculate the sentiment similarities of micro-blog users based on a sentiment feature set which is extracted from users\u2019 tweets. Sentiment similarities are used to filter the primary recommendation list and find users who have similar attitudes on the same topic. The goal of those two steps is to make the social recommender system much more precise and to satisfy users\u2019 psychological preferences. At the end, we use this new framework deal with big real-world data. The recommendation results of diabetes accounts of Weibo show that our method outperforms other social recommender systems."

Forged user-generated content data, such as user ratings and reviews, are used by attackers to manipulate recommendation rankings. Shilling attack detection in recommender systems is of great significance to maintain the fairness and sustainability of recommender systems. The current studies have problems in terms of the poor universality of algorithms, difficulty in selection of user profile attributes, and lack of an optimization mechanism. In this paper, a shilling behaviour detection structure based on abnormal group user findings and rating time series analysis is proposed. This paper adds to the current understanding in the field by studying the credibility evaluation model in-depth based on the rating prediction model to derive proximity-based predictions. A method for detecting suspicious ratings based on suspicious time windows and target item analysis is proposed. Suspicious rating time segments are determined by constructing a time series, and data streams of the rating items are examined and suspicious rating segments are checked. To analyse features of shilling attacks by a group user's credibility, an abnormal group user discovery method based on time series and time window is proposed. Standard testing datasets are used to verify the effect of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "With the advent of web technology, user-generated textual reviews are becoming increasingly accumulated on many e-commerce websites. These reviews contain not only the user comments on different aspects of the products but also the user sentiments associated with the aspects. Although these user sentiments serve as vital side information for improving the performance of recommender systems, most existing approaches ignore to fully exploit them in modeling the fine-grained user-item interaction for improving recommender system performance. Thus, this paper proposes a sentiment-aware deep recommender system with neural attention network (SDRA), which can capture both the aspects of products and the underlying user sentiments associated with the aspects for improving the recommendation system performance. Particularly, a semi-supervised topic model is designed to extract the aspects of the product and the associated sentiment lexicons from the user textual reviews, which are then incorporated into a long short term memory (LSTM) encoder via an interactive neural attention mechanism for better learning of the user and item sentiment-aware representation. Furthermore, a co-attention mechanism is introduced to better model the fine-grained user-item interaction for improving predictive performance. The extensive experiments on different datasets showed that our proposed <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SDRA</b> model can achieve better performance over the baseline approaches."

Destinations are at the heart of travel decisions but yet it is difficult for travelers to find quality information relating to destinations and even more for Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) to distribute their tourism offer. Thus, a wide range of new technologies - so called recommendation technologies - have emerged aligning destination information with booking facilities to convert destination search into online bookings.

    "title": "An Empirical Study on Recommendation with Multiple Types of Feedback",
    "abstract": "User feedback like clicks and ratings on recommended items provides important information for recommender systems to predict users' interests in unseen items. Most systems rely on models trained using a single type of feedback, e.g., ratings for movie recommendation and clicks for online news recommendation. However, in addition to the primary feedback, many systems also allow users to provide other types of feedback, e.g., liking or sharing an article, or hiding all articles from a source. These additional feedback potentially provides extra information for the recommendation models. To optimize user experience and business objectives, it is important for a recommender system to use both the primary feedback and additional feedback. This paper presents an empirical study on various training methods for incorporating multiple user feedback types based on LinkedIn recommendation products. We study three important problems that we face at LinkedIn: (1) Whether to send an email based on clicks and complaints, (2) how to rank updates in LinkedIn feeds based on clicks and hides and (3) how jointly optimize for viral actions and clicks in LinkedIn feeds. Extensive offline experiments on historical data show the effectiveness of these methods in different situations. Online A/B testing results further demonstrate the impact of these methods on LinkedIn production systems."

They have been successfully applied in various industries, such as e-commerce, education and digital health. On the other hand, clustering approaches can help the recommender systems to group users into appropriate clusters, which are considered as neighborhoods in prediction process. Although it is a fact that preferences of users vary over time, traditional clustering approaches fail to consider this important factor. To address this problem, a social recommender system is proposed in this paper, which is based on a temporal clustering approach. Specifically, the temporal information of ratings provided by users on items and also social information among the users are considered in the proposed method. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the quality of recommendations based on the proposed method is significantly higher than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and coverage metrics."

To identify a user's preference in the cold state, existing recommender systems, such as Netflix, initially provide items to a user; we call those items evidence candidates. Recommendations are then made based on the items selected by the user. Previous recommendation studies have two limitations: (1) the users who consumed a few items have poor recommendations and (2) inadequate evidence candidates are used to identify user preferences. We propose a meta-learning-based recommender system called MeLU to overcome these two limitations. From meta-learning, which can rapidly adopt new task with a few examples, MeLU can estimate new user's preferences with a few consumed items. In addition, we provide an evidence candidate selection strategy that determines distinguishing items for customized preference estimation. We validate MeLU with two benchmark datasets, and the proposed model reduces at least 5.92% mean absolute error than two comparative models on the datasets. We also conduct a user study experiment to verify the evidence selection strategy."

Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources.Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft.A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended.

Companies address these concerns with several risk reduction strategies, but none of them is able to guarantee cryptographic secureness. To close that gap, the present paper proposes a novel recommender system using the advantages of blockchain-supported secure multiparty computation.

Expected benefits are a reduction of fraud and misuse and a higher willingness to share personal data.

In many applications, it is desirable to provide real-time recommendations in large-scale scenarios. The main problem in applying streaming algorithms for recommendations is that the in-core storage space for memory-resident operations is quite limited.

There are several parameters specific to multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners that increase or decrease patient dose systematically compared to older single detector computed tomography (SDCT) scanners. This document briefly reviews the MDCT technology, radiation dose in MDCT, including differences from SDCT and factors that affect dose, radiation risks, and the responsibilities for patient dose management. The document recommends that users need to understand the relationship between patient dose and image quality and be aware that image quality in CT is often higher than that necessary for diagnostic confidence. Automatic exposure control (AEC) does not totally free the operator from selection of scan parameters, and awareness of individual systems is important. Scanning protocols cannot simply be transferred between scanners from different manufacturers and should be determined for each MDCT. If the image quality is appropriately specified by the user, and suited to the clinical task, there will be a reduction in patient dose for most patients. Understanding of some parameters is not intuitive and the selection of image quality parameter values in AEC systems is not straightforward. Examples of some clinical situation shave been included to demonstrate dose management, e.g. CT examinations of the chest, the heart for coronary calcium quantification and non-invasive coronary angiography, colonography, the urinary tract, children, pregnant patients, trauma cases, and CT guided interventions. CT is increasingly being used to replace conventional x-ray studies and it is important that patient dose is given careful consideration, particularly with repeated or multiple examinations."

In order to exploit the natural graph-based structure of RDF data, we study the impact of the knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation algorithm. In more detail, we investigate whether the integration of LOD-based features improves the effectiveness of the algorithm and to what extent the choice of different feature selection techniques influences its performance in terms of accuracy and diversity. The experimental evaluation on two state of the art datasets shows a clear correlation between the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize a specific evaluation metric. Moreover, the graph-based algorithm leveraging LOD-based features is able to overcome several state of the art baselines, such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, thus confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

The evaluation of these has however not been matched and is threatening to impede the further development of recommender systems. In this paper we propose an approach that addresses this impasse by formulating a novel evaluation concept adopting aspects from recommender systems research and industry. Our model can express the quality of a recommender algorithm from three perspectives, the end consumer (user), the service provider and the vendor (business and technique for both). We review current benchmarking activities and point out their shortcomings, which are addressed by our model. We also explain how our 3D benchmarking framework would apply to a specific use case."

    "title": "Collaborative future event recommendation",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate a method for collaborative ranking of future events. Previous work on recommender systems typically relies on feedback on a particular item, such as a movie, and generalizes this to other items or other people. In contrast, we examine a setting where no feedback exists on the particular item. Because direct feedback does not exist for events that have not taken place, we recommend them based on individuals' preferences for past events, combined collaboratively with other peoples' likes and dislikes. We examine the topic of unseen item recommendation through a user study of academic (scientific) talk recommendation, where we aim to correctly estimate a ranking function for each user, predicting which talks would be of most interest to them. Then by decomposing user parameters into shared and individual dimensions, we induce a similarity metric between users based on the degree to which they share these dimensions. We show that the collaborative ranking predictions of future events are more effective than pure content-based recommendation. Finally, to further reduce the need for explicit user feedback, we suggest an active learning approach for eliciting feedback and a method for incorporating available implicit user cues."

    "abstract": "Chemically relevant compositions (CRCs) and atomic arrangements of inorganic compounds have been collected as inorganic crystal structure databases. Machine-learning is a unique approach to search for currently unknown CRCs from vast candidates. Herein we propose matrix- and tensor-based recommender system approaches to predict currently unknown CRCs from database entries of CRCs. Firstly, the performance of the recommender system approaches to discover currently unknown CRCs is examined. A Tucker decomposition recommender system shows the best discovery rate of CRCs as the majority of the top 100 recommended ternary and quaternary compositions correspond to CRCs. Secondly, systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the phase stability of the recommended currently unknown CRCs. The phase stability of the 27 compositions reveals that 23 currently unknown compounds are stable. These results indicate that the recommender system has great potential to accelerate the discovery of new compounds."

However, the types of recommendations available to the users in these recommender systems are typically determined by the vendor and therefore are not flexible.

REQUEST is based on the multidimensional model of recommender systems that supports additional contextual dimensions besides traditional User and Item dimensions and also OLAP-type aggregation and filtering capabilities. This paper also presents the recommendation algebra RA, shows how REQUEST recommendations can be mapped into this algebra, and analyzes the expressive power of the query language and the algebra. This paper also shows how users can customize their recommendations using REQUEST queries through a series of examples."

    "title": "SPrank",
    "abstract": "In most real-world scenarios, the ultimate goal of recommender system applications is to suggest a short ranked list of items, namely top- N recommendations, that will appeal to the end user. Often, the problem of computing top- N recommendations is mainly tackled with a two-step approach. The system focuses first on predicting the unknown ratings, which are eventually used to generate a ranked recommendation list. Actually, the top- N recommendation task can be directly seen as a ranking problem where the main goal is not to accurately predict ratings but to directly find the best-ranked list of items to recommend. In this article we present SPrank, a novel hybrid recommendation algorithm able to compute top- N recommendations exploiting freely available knowledge in the Web of Data. In particular, we employ DBpedia, a well-known encyclopedic knowledge base in the Linked Open Data cloud, to extract semantic path-based features and to eventually compute top- N recommendations in a learning-to-rank fashion. Experiments with three datasets related to different domains (books, music, and movies) prove the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms."

Poor quality is one major challenge in collaborative filtering recommender systems. Sparsity of users' ratings is the major reason causing the poor quality. The popular same value and singular value decomposition techniques are able to alleviate this issue. But they also introduce new problems. A collaborative filtering based on rough set theory was proposed to solve this problem, which predicts values of the null ratings in the candidates, and gets the results using user's neighbors. Experimental results show that this method can increase the accuracy of the predicted values, resulting in improving recommendation quality of the collaborative filtering recommender system."

In recent years, it has been shown that these methods are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., subtle but non-random perturbations designed to force recommendation models to produce erroneous outputs. The goal of this survey is two-fold: (i) to present recent advances on adversarial machine learning (AML) for the security of RS (i.e., attacking and defense recommendation models) and (ii) to show another successful application of AML in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generative applications, thanks to their ability for learning (high-dimensional) data distributions. In this survey, we provide an exhaustive literature review of 76 articles published in major RS and ML journals and conferences. This review serves as a reference for the RS community working on the security of RS or on generative models using GANs to improve their quality."

Prevalence estimates indicate that 2% to 3% of the population in the developed world suffer from NeP, which suggests that up to one million Canadians have this disabling condition. Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of NeP are therefore urgently needed. Randomized, controlled trials, systematic reviews and existing guidelines focusing on the pharmacological management of NeP were evaluated at a consensus meeting. Medications are recommended in the guidelines if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound, randomized, controlled trial showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Recommendations for treatment are based on degree of evidence of analgesic efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are certain antidepressants (tricyclics) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin). Second-line treatments recommended are serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and topical lidocaine. Tramadol and controlled-release opioid analgesics are recommended as third-line treatments for moderate to severe pain. Recommended fourth-line treatments include cannabinoids, methadone and anticonvulsants with lesser evidence of efficacy, such as lamotrigine, topiramate and valproic acid. Treatment must be individualized for each patient based on efficacy, side-effect profile and drug accessibility, including cost. Further studies are required to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes, and treatment of pediatric and central NeP."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms find applications in inventory control, recommender systems, vehicular traffic management, cloud computing, and robotics. The real-world complications arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with the basic assumptions underlying classical RL algorithms. RL agents in these applications often need to react and adapt to changing operating conditions. A significant part of research on single-agent RL techniques focuses on developing algorithms when the underlying assumption of stationary environment model is relaxed. This article provides a survey of RL methods developed for handling dynamically varying environment models. The goal of methods not limited by the stationarity assumption is to help autonomous agents adapt to varying operating conditions. This is possible either by minimizing the rewards lost during learning by RL agent or by finding a suitable policy for the RL agent that leads to efficient operation of the underlying system. A representative collection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this work along with their categorization and their relative merits and demerits. Additionally, we also review works that are tailored to application domains. Finally, we discuss future enhancements for this field."

Recommender systems have proven to overcome information overload issues in the retrieval of information, but still suffer from persistent problems related to cold-start and data sparsity. On the flip side, sentiment analysis technique has been known in translating text and expressing user preferences. It is often used to help online businesses to observe customers' feedbacks on their products as well as try to understand customer needs and preferences. However, the current solution for embedding traditional sentiment analysis in recommender solutions seems to have limitations when involving multiple domains. Therefore, an issue called domain sensitivity should be addressed. In this paper, a sentiment-based model with contextual information for recommender system was proposed. A novel solution for domain sensitivity was proposed by applying a contextual information sentiment-based model for recommender systems. In evaluating the contributions of contextual information in sentiment-based recommendations, experiments were divided into standard rating model, standard sentiment model and contextual information model. Results showed that the proposed contextual information sentiment-based model illustrates better performance as compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach."

The proposed two-stage solution first transfers user preferences from auxiliary network by learning cross-network behavior correlations, and then integrates the transferred preferences with the observed behaviors on target network in an adaptive fashion. Experimental results show that the proposed cross-network collaborative solution achieves superior performance not only in term of accuracy, but also in improving the diversity and novelty of the recommended videos."

    "abstract": "In recommender systems (RS), many models are designed to predict ratings of items for the target user. To improve the performance for rating prediction, some studies have introduced tags into recommender systems. Tags benefit RS considerably, however, they are also redundant and ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model TRSDL (tag-aware recommender system based on deep learning) to improve the performance of tag-aware recommender systems (TRS). First, TRSDL uses pre-trained word embeddings to represent user-defined tags, and constructs item and user profiles based on the items\u2019 tags set and users\u2019 tagging behaviors. Then, it utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract the latent features of items and users, respectively. Finally, it predicts ratings from these latent features. The model not only addresses tag limitations and takes advantage of semantic tag information but also learns more advanced implicit features via deep structures. We evaluated our proposed approach and several baselines on MovieLens-20 m, and the experimental results demonstrate that TRSDL significantly outperforms all the baselines (including the state-of-the-art models BiasedMF and I-AutoRec). In addition, we also explore the impacts of network depth and type on model performance."

Such support ranges from suggesting program entities to taking into account pertinent Q&A pages. However, current recommender systems limit the context analysis to change history and developers' activities in the IDE, without considering what a developer has already consulted or perused, e.g., by performing searches from the Web browser. Given the faceted nature of many programming tasks, and the incompleteness of the information provided by a single artifact, several heterogeneous resources are required to obtain the broader picture needed by a developer to accomplish a task. We present Libra, a holistic recommender system. It supports the process of searching and navigating the information needed by constructing a holistic meta-information model of the resources perused by a developer, analyzing their semantic relationships, and augmenting the web browser with a dedicated interactive navigation chart. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Libra provides evidence that a holistic analysis of a developer's information context can indeed offer comprehensive and contextualized support to information navigation and retrieval during software development."

Hence, real-time computing on edge could help capture user preferences more preciously and thus make more satisfactory recommendations.

However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, etc. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology ``bias'' is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic.

Therefore, optimization of lifestyle factors known to influence peak bone mass and strength is an important strategy aimed at reducing risk of osteoporosis or low bone mass later in life. The National Osteoporosis Foundation has issued this scientific statement to provide evidence-based guidance and a national implementation strategy for the purpose of helping individuals achieve maximal peak bone mass early in life. In this scientific statement, we (1) report the results of an evidence-based review of the literature since 2000 on factors that influence achieving the full genetic potential for skeletal mass; (2) recommend lifestyle choices that promote maximal bone health throughout the lifespan; (3) outline a research agenda to address current gaps; and (4) identify implementation strategies. We conducted a systematic review of the role of individual nutrients, food patterns, special issues, contraceptives, and physical activity on bone mass and strength development in youth. An evidence grading system was applied to describe the strength of available evidence on these individual modifiable lifestyle factors that may (or may not) influence the development of peak bone mass (Table 1). A summary of the grades for each of these factors is given below. We describe the underpinning biology of these relationships as well as other factors for which a systematic review approach was not possible. Articles published since 2000, all of which followed the report by Heaney et al. [1] published in that year, were considered for this scientific statement. This current review is a systematic update of the previous review conducted by the National Osteoporosis Foundation [1]. [Table: see text] Considering the evidence-based literature review, we recommend lifestyle choices that promote maximal bone health from childhood through young to late adolescence and outline a research agenda to address current gaps in knowledge. The best evidence (grade A) is available for positive effects of calcium intake and physical activity, especially during the late childhood and peripubertal years-a critical period for bone accretion. Good evidence is also available for a role of vitamin D and dairy consumption and a detriment of DMPA injections. However, more rigorous trial data on many other lifestyle choices are needed and this need is outlined in our research agenda. Implementation strategies for lifestyle modifications to promote development of peak bone mass and strength within one's genetic potential require a multisectored (i.e., family, schools, healthcare systems) approach."

They are in a constant need for personalization in order to make effective suggestions and to provide valuable information of items available. A way to reach such personalization is by means of an alternative data mining technique called classification based on association, which uses association rules in a prediction perspective. In this work we propose a hybrid methodology for recommender systems, which uses collaborative filtering and content-based approaches in a joint method taking advantage from the strengths of both approaches. Moreover, we also employ fuzzy logic to enhance recommendations' quality and effectiveness. In order to analyze the behavior of the techniques used in our methodology, we accomplished a case study using real data gathered from two recommender systems. Results revealed that such techniques can be applied effectively in recommender systems, minimizing the effects typical drawbacks they present."

The aim of a social user recommendation is to suggest new friends having similar interests. In order to identify such interests, current recommender algorithms exploit social network information or the similarity of user-generated content. The rationale of this work is that users may share similar interests but have different opinions on them. As a result, considering the contribution of user sentiments, can yield benefits in recommending possible friends to follow. In this paper we propose a user recommendation technique based on a novel weighting function, we named sentimentvolume-objectivity (SVO) function, which takes into account not only user interests, but also his sentiments. Such function allows us to build richer user profiles to employ in the recommendation process than other content-based approaches. Preliminary results based on a comparative analysis show the benefits of the advanced approach in comparison with some state-of-the-art user recommender systems."

The derived algorithm is computationally simple, while experimental results show high acceptance ratio of the proposed recommendations."

    "title": "Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Total Variation for Visual Data Inpainting",
    "abstract": "With the advance of acquisition techniques, plentiful higherorder tensor data sets are built up in a great variety of fields such as computer vision, neuroscience, remote sensing and recommender systems. The real-world tensors often contain missing values, which makes tensor completion become a prerequisite to utilize them. Previous studies have shown that imposing a low-rank constraint on tensor completion produces impressive performances. In this paper, we argue that low-rank constraint, albeit useful, is not effective enough to exploit the local smooth and piecewise priors of visual data. We propose integrating total variation into low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) to address the drawback. As LRTC can be formulated by both tensor unfolding and tensor decomposition, we develop correspondingly two methods, namely LRTC-TV-I and LRTC-TVII, and their iterative solvers. Extensive experimental results on color image and medical image inpainting tasks show the effectiveness and superiority of the two methods against state-of-the-art competitors."

    "title": "DAML: Dual Attention Mutual Learning between Ratings and Reviews for Item Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Despite the great success of many matrix factorization based collaborative filtering approaches, there is still much space for improvement in recommender system field. One main obstacle is the cold-start and data sparseness problem, requiring better solutions. Recent studies have attempted to integrate review information into rating prediction. However, there are two main problems: (1) most of existing works utilize a static and independent method to extract the latent feature representation of user and item reviews ignoring the correlation between the latent features, which may fail to capture the preference of users comprehensively. (2) there is no effective framework that unifies ratings and reviews. Therefore, we propose a novel d ual a ttention m utual l earning between ratings and reviews for item recommendation, named DAML. Specifically, we utilize local and mutual attention of the convolutional neural network to jointly learn the features of reviews to enhance the interpretability of the proposed DAML model. Then the rating features and review features are integrated into a unified neural network model, and the higher-order nonlinear interaction of features are realized by the neural factorization machines to complete the final rating prediction. Experiments on the five real-world datasets show that DAML achieves significantly better rating prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the attention mechanism can highlight the relevant information in reviews to increase the interpretability of rating prediction."

Recommender System (RS) overcomes the problem of information overload and suggests items that interest to a user. It has gained a lot of popularity in past decades and huge amount of work has been done in this field. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular and widely used approach for RS which tries to analyze the user's interest over the target item on the basis of views expressed by other like-minded users. This paper gives a brief idea of various approaches used for Recommender System and provides an insight of Collaborative Filtering technique. Here, we also discuss well-known methods for CF i.e. Memory-based, Model-based, and hybrid approaches and at last we focus on research challenges that need to be addressed."

This can be done in many different ways the platform may be developed from the ground up, an existing recommender engine may be contracted (OracleAS Personalization), code libraries can be adapted, or a platform may be selected and tailored to suit (LensKit, MymediaLite, Apache Mahout, etc.). In some cases, a combination of these approaches will be employed. For E-commerce projects, and particularly in the E-commerce website t, the ideal situation is to find an open-source platform with many active contributors that provides a rich and varied set of recommender system functions that meets all or most of the baseline development requirements. Short of finding this ideal solution, some minor customization to an already existing system may be the best approach to meet the specific development requirements. Various libraries have been released to support the development of recommender systems for some time, but it is only relatively recently that larger scale, open-source platforms have become readily available. In the context of such platforms, evaluation tools are important both to verify and validate baseline platform functionality, as well as to provide support for testing new techniques and approaches developed on top of the platform. Apache Mahout as an enabling platform for research and have faced both of these issues in employing it as part of work in collaborative filtering recommenders."

    "abstract": "The Fortran LHAPDF library has been a long-term workhorse in particle physics, providing standardised access to parton density functions for experimental and phenomenological purposes alike, following on from the venerable PDFLIB package. During Run 1 of the LHC, however, several fundamental limitations in LHAPDF\u2019s design have became deeply problematic, restricting the usability of the library for important physics-study procedures and providing dangerous avenues by which to silently obtain incorrect results. In this paper we present the LHAPDF 6 library, a ground-up re-engineering of the PDFLIB/LHAPDF paradigm for PDF access which removes all limits on use of concurrent PDF sets, massively reduces static memory requirements, offers improved CPU performance, and fixes fundamental bugs in multi-set access to PDF metadata. The new design, restricted for now to interpolated PDFs, uses centralised numerical routines and a powerful cascading metadata system to decouple software releases from provision of new PDF data and allow completely general parton content. More than 200 PDF sets have been migrated from LHAPDF 5 to the new universal data format, via a stringent quality control procedure. LHAPDF 6 is supported by many Monte Carlo generators and other physics programs, in some cases via a full set of compatibility routines, and is recommended for the demanding PDF access needs of LHC Run 2 and beyond."

Cross-domain recommenders address the sparsity problem by using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to transfer knowledge from a dense domain into a sparse target domain. In this paper we propose a transfer learning technique that extracts knowledge from multiple domains containing rich data (e.g., movies and music) and generates recommendations for a sparse target domain (e.g., games). Our method learns the relatedness between the different source domains and the target domain, without requiring overlapping users between domains. The model integrates the appropriate amount of knowledge from each domain in order to enrich the target domain data. Experiments with several datasets reveal that, using multiple sources and the relatedness between domains improves accuracy of results."

Although the open call format enables wide task accessibility, potential developers must choose from a dauntingly large set of task options (usually more than one hundred available tasks on TopCoder each day). Inappropriate developer-task matching may lower the quality of the software deliverables. In this paper, we employ content-based recommendation techniques to automatically match tasks and developers. The approach learns particular interests from registration history and mines winner history to favour appropriate developers. We measure the performance of our approach by defining accuracy and diversity metrics. We evaluate our recommendation approach by introducing 4 machine learners on 3,094 historical tasks from TopCoder. The evaluation results show that promising accuracy and diversity are achievable (accuracy from 50% to 71% and diversity from 40% to 52% when recommending reliable developers).We also provide advice extracted from our results to guide the crowdsourcing platform in building a recommender system in practice."

    "abstract": "In order to address the data sparsity problem in recommender systems, in recent years, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) leverages the relatively richer information from a source domain to improve the recommendation performance on a target domain with sparser information. However, each of the two domains may be relatively richer in certain types of information (e.g., ratings, reviews, user profiles, item details, and tags), and thus, if we can leverage such information well, it is possible to improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously (i.e., dual-target CDR), rather than a single target domain only. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, DTCDR, for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation. In DTCDR, we first extensively utilize rating and multi-source content information to generate rating and document embeddings of users and items. Then, based on Multi-Task Learning (MTL), we design an adaptable embedding-sharing strategy to combine and share the embeddings of common users across domains, with which DTCDR can improve the recommendation performance on both richer and sparser (i.e., dual-target) domains simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that DTCDR can significantly improve the recommendation accuracies on both richer and sparser domains and outperform the state-of-the-art single-domain and cross-domain approaches."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems, which aim to suggest personalized lists of items for users, have drawn a lot of attention. In fact, many of these state-of-the-art recommender systems have been built on deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies have shown that these deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks, such as data poisoning, which generate fake users to promote a selected set of items. Correspondingly, effective defense strategies have been developed to detect these generated users with fake profiles. Thus, new strategies of creating more `realistic' user profiles to promote a set of items should be investigated to further understand the vulnerability of DNNs based recommender systems. In this work, we present a novel framework CopyAttack. It is a reinforcement learning based black-box attacking method that harnesses real users from a source domain by copying their profiles into the target domain with the goal of promoting a subset of items. CopyAttack is constructed to both efficiently and effectively learn policy gradient networks that first select, then further refine/craft user profiles from the source domain, and ultimately copy them into the target domain. CopyAttack's goal is to maximize the hit ratio of the targeted items in the Top-k recommendation list of the users in the target domain. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets and empirically verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The implementation of CopyAttack is available at https://github.com/wenqifan03/CopyAttack."

METHODS A multidisciplinary consensus conference using published literature developed an arbitrary classification system of prognostic marker value (Category I, IIA, IIB, III, and IV), which forms the framework for this report. RESULTS The working party concluded that several T categories should be subdivided: pTis into intraepithelial carcinoma (pTie) and intramucosal carcinoma (pTim); pT1 into pT1a and pT1b corresponding to the absence or presence of blood or lymphatic vessel invasion, respectively; and pT4 into pT4a and pT4b according to the absence or presence of tumor involving the surface of the specimen, respectively. The working party also recommended that TNM groups be stratified based on the presence or absence of elevated serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (\u2265 5 ng/mL) on preoperative clinical examination. In addition, the working party also concluded that carcinoma of the appendix should be excluded from the colorectal carcinoma staging system because of fundamental differences in natural history. CONCLUSIONS The TNM categories and stage groupings for colorectal carcinoma published in the current AJCC manual have clinical and academic value. However, a few categories require subdivision to provide increasing discrimination for individual patients. The serum marker CEA should be added to the staging system, whereas multiple other factors should be recorded as part of good clinical practice. Although many molecular and oncogenic markers show promise to supplement or modify the current staging systems eventually, to the authors' knowledge none have yet been evaluated sufficiently to recommend their inclusion in the TNM system.

    "title": "Exploiting Implicit Influence From Information Propagation for Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Social recommender systems have attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry. On social media, users' ratings and reviews can be observed by all users, and have implicit influence on their future ratings. When these users make subsequent decisions about an item, they may be affected by existing ratings on the item. Thus, implicit influence propagates among the users who rated the same items, and it has significant impact on users' ratings. However, implicit influence propagation and its effect on recommendation rarely have been studied. In this article, we propose an information propagation-based social recommendation method (SoInp) and model the implicit user influence from the perspective of information propagation. The implicit influence is inferred from ratings on the same items. We investigate the concrete effect of implicit user influence in the propagation process and introduce it into recommender systems. Furthermore, we incorporate the implicit user influence and explicit trust information in the matrix factorization framework. To demonstrate the performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that SoInp makes notable improvements in rating prediction."

    "abstract": "In the modern tourism industry, next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is an important mobile service as it effectively aids hesitating travelers to decide the next POI to visit. Currently, most next POI recommender systems are built upon a cloud-based paradigm, where the recommendation models are trained and deployed on the powerful cloud servers. When a recommendation request is made by a user via mobile devices, the current contextual information will be uploaded to the cloud servers to help the well-trained models generate personalized recommendation results. However, in reality, this paradigm heavily relies on high-quality network connectivity, and is subject to high energy footprint in the operation and increasing privacy concerns among the public. To bypass these defects, we propose a novel Light Location Recommender System (LLRec) to perform next POI recommendation locally on resource-constrained mobile devices. To make LLRec fully compatible with the limited computing resources and memory space, we leverage FastGRNN, a lightweight but effective gated Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as its main building block, and significantly compress the model size by adopting the tensor-train composition in the embedding layer. As a compact model, LLRec maintains its robustness via an innovative teacher-student training framework, where a powerful teacher model is trained on the cloud to learn essential knowledge from available contextual data, and the simplified student model LLRec is trained under the guidance of the teacher model. The final LLRec is downloaded and deployed on users\u2019 mobile devices to generate accurate recommendations solely utilizing users\u2019 local data. As a result, LLRec significantly reduces the dependency on cloud servers, thus allowing for next POI recommendation in a stable, cost-effective and secure way. Extensive experiments on two large-scale recommendation datasets further demonstrate the superiority of our proposed solution."

While they offer great promises, they also raise concerns: lack of transparency, reduction of diversity, little to no user control. In this paper, we align with the normative turn in computer science which scrutinizes the ethical and societal implications of RS. We focus and elaborate on the concept of user control because that mitigates multiple problems at once. Taking the news industry as our domain, we conducted four focus groups, or moderated think-aloud sessions, with Dutch news readers (N=21) to systematically study how people evaluate different control mechanisms (at the input, process, and output phase) in a News Recommender Prototype (NRP). While these mechanisms are sometimes met with distrust about the actual control they offer, we found that an intelligible user profile (including reading history and flexible preferences settings), coupled with possibilities to influence the recommendation algorithms is highly valued, especially when these control mechanisms can be operated in relation to achieving personal goals. By bringing (future) users' perspectives to the fore, this paper contributes to a richer understanding of why and how to design for user control in recommender systems."

In this work, we propose to study negative sampling by leveraging both the user-item graph structure and GNNs' aggregation process. We present the MixGCF method---a general negative sampling plugin that can be directly used to train GNN-based recommender systems. In MixGCF, rather than sampling raw negatives from data, we design the hop mixing technique to synthesize hard negatives. Specifically, the idea of hop mixing is to generate the synthetic negative by aggregating embeddings from different layers of raw negatives' neighborhoods. The layer and neighborhood selection process are optimized by a theoretically-backed hard selection strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by using MixGCF, state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation models can be consistently and significantly improved, e.g., 26% for NGCF and 22% for LightGCN in terms of [email protected]"

As part of its Programme of Work, NATO Research Study Group 27 on Cognitive Task Analysis has undertaken the task of reviewing existing cognitive task analysis techniques.

RSG.27 has also organized a workshop with experts in the field of cognitive task analysis. The most important issues that were discussed during the workshop were: (1) the use of CTA in the design of new systems, (2) the question when to use what technique, and (3) the role of CTA in system design.

As a specific example, media service providers, such as Netflix, can improve their service by recommending desirable content to each user. Most of the previous studies used explicit feedback of users, through likes and dislikes, to recommend items to their customers. However, in many cases, there is not much explicit feedback about items which cripples typical recommender systems to operate efficiently and provide accurate recommendation. In this paper, a percentage of view approach is proposed to find relevant movies for customers. To prove the effectiveness of the approach, first, it is shown that this feature can be a good indicator of users' like and dislike. Then the best approach is determined and used in a recommender system for Namava, a media service provider. Then the performance of this recommender system is compared to a random recommender system and the effectiveness of the approach is shown."

In addition, we introduce the results of an important new live-user study that evaluates the practical benefits of dynamic critiquing."

    "abstract": "The number of \"hits\" has been widely regarded as the lifeblood of many web systems, e.g., e-commerce systems, advertising systems and multimedia consumption systems. However, users would not hit an item if they cannot see it, or they are not interested in the item. Recommender system plays a critical role of discovering interesting items from near-infinite inventory and exhibiting them to potential users. Yet, two issues are crippling the recommender systems. One is \"how to handle new users\", and the other is \"how to surprise users\". The former is well-known as cold-start recommendation. In this paper, we show that the latter can be investigated as long-tail recommendation. We also exploit the benefits of jointly challenging both cold-start and long-tail recommendation, and propose a novel approach which can simultaneously handle both of them in a unified objective. For the cold-start problem, we learn from side information, e.g., user attributes, user social relationships, etc. Then, we transfer the learned knowledge to new users. For the long-tail recommendation, we decompose the overall interesting items into two parts: a low-rank part for short-head items and a sparse part for long-tail items. The two parts are independently revealed in the training stage, and transfered into the final recommendation for new users. Furthermore, we effectively formulate the two problems into a unified objective and present an iterative optimization algorithm. A fast extension of the method is proposed to reduce the complexity, and extensive theoretical analysis are provided to proof the bounds of our approach. At last, experiments of social recommendation on various real-world datasets, e.g., images, blogs, videos and musics, verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art work."

    "title": "Conversational Contextual Bandit: Algorithm and Application",
    "abstract": "Contextual bandit algorithms provide principled online learning solutions to balance the exploitation-exploration trade-off in various applications such as recommender systems. However, the learning speed of the traditional contextual bandit algorithms is often slow due to the need for extensive exploration. This poses a critical issue in applications like recommender systems, since users may need to provide feedbacks on a lot of uninterested items. To accelerate the learning speed, we generalize contextual bandit to conversational contextual bandit. Conversational contextual bandit leverages not only behavioral feedbacks on arms (e.g., articles in news recommendation), but also occasional conversational feedbacks on key-terms from the user. Here, a key-term can relate to a subset of arms, for example, a category of articles in news recommendation. We then design the Conversational UCB algorithm (ConUCB) to address two challenges in conversational contextual bandit: (1) which key-terms to select to conduct conversation, (2) how to leverage conversational feedbacks to accelerate the speed of bandit learning. We theoretically prove that ConUCB can achieve a smaller regret upper bound than the traditional contextual bandit algorithm LinUCB, which implies a faster learning speed. Experiments on synthetic data, as well as real datasets from Yelp and Toutiao, demonstrate the efficacy of the ConUCB algorithm."

    "abstract": "Larger student intakes by universities and the rise of education through Massive Open Online Courses has led to less direct contact time with teaching staff for each student. One potential way of addressing this contact deficit is to invite learners to engage in peer learning and peer support; however, without technological support they may be unable to discover suitable peer connections that can enhance their learning experience. Two different research subfields with ties to recommender systems provide partial solutions to this problem. Reciprocal recommender systems provide sophisticated filtering techniques that enable users to connect with one another. To date, however, the main focus of reciprocal recommender systems has been on providing recommendation in online dating sites. Recommender systems for technology enhanced learning have employed and tailored exemplary recommenders towards use in education, with a focus on recommending learning content rather than other users. In this paper, we first discuss the importance of supporting peer learning and the role recommending reciprocal peers can play in educational settings. We then introduce our open-source course-level recommendation platform called RiPPLE that has the capacity to provide reciprocal peer recommendation. The proposed reciprocal peer recommender algorithm is evaluated against key criteria such as scalability, reciprocality, coverage, and quality and shows improvement over a baseline recommender. Primary results indicate that the system can help learners connect with peers based on their knowledge gaps and reciprocal preferences, with designed flexibility to address key limitations of existing algorithms identified in the literature."

    "abstract": "Sales diversity is considered a key feature of Recommender Systems from a business perspective. Sales diversity is also linked with the long-tail novelty of recommendations, a quality dimension from the user perspective. We explore the inversion of the recommendation task as a means to enhance sales diversity - and indirectly novelty - by selecting which users an item should be recommended to instead of the other way around. We address the inverted task by two approaches: a) inverting the rating matrix, and b) defining a probabilistic reformulation which isolates the popularity component of arbitrary recommendation algorithms. We find that the first approach gives rise to interesting reformulations of nearest-neighbor algorithms, which essentially introduce a new neighbor selection policy. The second approach, as well as the first, ultimately result in substantial sales diversity enhancements, and improved trade-offs with recommendation precision and novelty. Two experiments on movie and music recommendation datasets show the effectiveness of the resulting approach, even when compared to direct optimization approaches of the target metrics proposed in prior work."

In general, they are independently investigated in different communities. This paper, however, reveals that ZSL and CSR are two extensions of the same intension. Both of them, for instance, attempt to predict unseen classes and involve two spaces, one for direct feature representation and the other for supplementary description. Yet there is no existing approach which addresses CSR from the ZSL perspective. This work, for the first time, formulates CSR as a ZSL problem, and a tailor-made ZSL method is proposed to handle CSR. Specifically, we propose a Lowrank Linear Auto-Encoder (LLAE), which challenges three cruxes, i.e., domain shift, spurious correlations and computing efficiency, in this paper. LLAE consists of two parts, a low-rank encoder maps user behavior into user attributes and a symmetric decoder reconstructs user behavior from user attributes. Extensive experiments on both ZSL and CSR tasks verify that the proposed method is a win-win formulation, i.e., not only can CSR be handled by ZSL models with a significant performance improvement compared with several conventional state-of-the-art methods, but the consideration of CSR can benefit ZSL as well."

    "title": "Graph Embedding for Recommendation against Attribute Inference Attacks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, recommender systems play a pivotal role in helping users identify the most suitable items that satisfy personal preferences. As user-item interactions can be naturally modelled as graph-structured data, variants of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have become a well-established building block in the latest recommenders. Due to the wide utilization of sensitive user profile data, existing recommendation paradigms are likely to expose users to the threat of privacy breach, and GCN-based recommenders are no exception. Apart from the leakage of raw user data, the fragility of current recommenders under inference attacks offers malicious attackers a backdoor to estimate users\u2019 private attributes via their behavioral footprints and the recommendation results. However, little attention has been paid to developing recommender systems that can defend such attribute inference attacks, and existing works achieve attack resistance by either sacrificing considerable recommendation accuracy or only covering specific attack models or protected information. In our paper, we propose GERAI, a novel differentially private graph convolutional network to address such limitations. Specifically, in GERAI, we bind the information perturbation mechanism in differential privacy with the recommendation capability of graph convolutional networks. Furthermore, based on local differential privacy and functional mechanism, we innovatively devise a dual-stage encryption paradigm to simultaneously enforce privacy guarantee on users\u2019 sensitive features and the model optimization process. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GERAI in terms of its resistance to attribute inference attacks and recommendation effectiveness."

    "title": "Introduction to social recommendation",
    "abstract": "As the exponential growth of information generated on the World Wide Web, Social Recommendation has emerged as one of the hot research topics recently. Social Recommendation forms a specific type of information filtering technique that attempts to suggest information (blogs, news, music, travel plans, web pages, images, tags, etc.) that are likely to interest the users. Social Recommendation involves the investigation of collective intelligence by using computational techniques such as machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, etc. on social behavior data collected from blogs, wikis, recommender systems, question & answer communities, query logs, tags, etc. from areas such as social networks, social search, social media, social bookmarks, social news, social knowledge sharing, and social games. In this tutorial, we will introduce Social Recommendation and elaborate on how the various characteristics and aspects are involved in the social platforms for collective intelligence. Moreover, we will discuss the challenging issues involved in Social Recommendation in the context of theory and models of social networks, methods to improve recommender systems using social contextual information, ways to deal with partial and incomplete information in the social context, scalability and algorithmic issues with social computational techniques."

In this paper we present a methodology for the implicit acquisition of affective labels for images. It is based on an emotion detection technique that takes as input the video sequences of the users' facial expressions. It extracts Gabor low level features from the video frames and employs a k nearest neighbors machine learning technique to generate affective labels in the valence-arousal-dominance space. We performed a comparative study of the performance of a content-based recommender (CBR) system for images that uses three types of metadata to model the users and the items: (i) generic metadata, (ii) explicitly acquired affective labels and (iii) implicitly acquired affective labels with the proposed methodology. The results show that the CBR performs best when explicit labels are used. However, implicitly acquired labels yield a significantly better performance of the CBR than generic metadata while being an unobtrusive feedback tool."

Users of these sites annotate and endorse content by tagging, and form social ties with other users by including them into their friendship network. The richness of social context raises the users\u2019 expectations with respect to the quality of served content, but also presents a unique opportunity for the design of semantically-enriched recommender systems. This paper presents a variety of methods for producing customized hotlists and evaluates their effectiveness on del.icio.us datasets. We model a user\u2019s interest in terms of the tags he uses to annotate content, and in terms of his explicitly stated and derived social ties, and demonstrate how such interest can be leveraged to produce holistic of very high quality. We also discuss possible research directions and outline strategies for the design of a social tagging recommender system."

In this paper, we address the case where no such additional data is available and propose a new Explainable Matrix Factorization (EMF) technique that computes an accurate top-$n$ recommendation list of items that are explainable. We also introduce new explanation quality metrics, that we call Mean Explainability Precision (MEP) and Mean Explainability Recall (MER)."

    "title": "Bootstrapping and Decentralizing Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "This thesis consists of three papers on recommender systems. \r\nThe first paper addresses the problem of making decentralized recommendations using a peer-to-peer architecture. Collaborating recommender agents are connected into a network of neighbors that exchange user recommendations to find new items to recommend. We achieved a performance comparable to a centralized system. \r\nThe second paper deals with the bootstrapping problem for centralized recommender systems. Most recommender systems learn from experience but initially there are no users and no rated items to learn from. To deal with this problem we have developed the Genesis method. The method bootstraps a recommender system with artificial user profiles sampled from a probabilistic model built from prior knowledge. The paper describes how this was done for a k-nearest neighbor recommender algorithm in the movie domain. We were able to improve the performance of a k-nearest neighbor algorithm for single predictions but not for rank ordered lists of recommendations. \r\nThe third paper identifies a new domain for recommendations \u2013 product configuration \u2013 where new recommender algorithms are needed. A system that helps users configuring their own PCs is described. Recommendations and a cluster-based help system together with a rule-based configurator assist the users in selecting appropriate features or complete PC configurations. The configurator ensures that users cannot choose incompatible components while the recommender system adds social information based on what other users have chosen. This introduces new complexity in the recommendation process on how to combine the recommendations from the configurator and the recommender system. The paper proposes (1) three new recommender algorithms on how to make recommendations in the domain of product configuration, (2) a method for adding social recommendations to a rule-based configurator and (3) a method for applying the Genesis method in this domain. In this case the Genesis method is implemented by a Bayesian belief net that captures the designers\u2019 prior knowledge on how to configure PCs. Then instances of complete configurations are sampled from the model and added to the recommender algorithm."

We first describe our adaptation of traditional recommender system algorithms to meet the unique requirements presented by the domain of software commands. A user study showed that our item-based collaborative filtering algorithm generates 2.1 times as many good suggestions as existing techniques. Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To evaluate the algorithms, we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD. This plug-in enabled us to perform a 6-week user study of real-time, within-application command recommendations in actual working environments. We report and visualize command usage behaviors during the study, and discuss how the recommendations affected users behaviors. In particular, we found that the plug-in successfully exposed users to new commands, as unique commands issued significantly increased."

    "abstract": "Owing to the enormous growth in information over the past few decades, the world has become a global village. The recommendation system remains the most widely used type of commercial websites. The personalized recommender system is of paramount importance in modeling user\u2019s preference on items based on their past interactions (e.g., ratings and clicks), known as collaborative filtering (CF) technique. Although CF is very important among the algorithms used in recommendation systems, it suffers some setbacks such as the sparsity of matrix ratings, scalability, and integrals nature of data. Several research studies have shown that the above-mentioned obstacle could be tackled with the help of matrix factorization (MF) techniques. In spite of the fact that the technique is likely to suffer from lack of some meaningful signals by using a low ranked approximation as well as lack of sparsity in times of denser singular vectors. Recently, deep learning techniques have proven to learn good representation in natural language processing, image classification, and so on. In this work, we propose a deep learning method of collaborative recommender systems (DLCRS). We have made a comparative study of the proposed method and existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach gives improved results compared to already existing methods. We empirically evaluate DLCRS on two famous datasets: 100K and 1M Movielens."

    "abstract": "Too many mobile applications in App stores results in information overload in App market. Mobile users are confused in choosing suitable and trustworthy mobile applications due to a large number of available candidates. A mobile application recommender system is a powerful tool that helps users solve this problem. However, there are few feasible recommender systems focusing on recommending mobile applications in the literature. First, few researches study user trust behavior based recommendation on mobile applications. Second, the accuracy and personalization of existing recommender systems need to be further improved. Particularly, privacy preservation is still an open issue in mobile application recommendation. In this paper, we propose two privacy-preserving mobile application recommendation schemes based on trust evaluation. Recommendations on mobile application are generated based on user trust behaviors of mobile application usage. In these two schemes, user private data can be preserved by applying our proposed security protocols and utilizing homomorphic encryption. We further implement two schemes and develop two mobile Apps that can be applied in different scenarios, i.e., a centralized cloud service and distributed social networking. Security analysis, performance evaluation and simulation results show that our schemes have sound security, efficiency, accuracy, and robustness."

Given pairwise dissimilarities between the elements of a 'source set' and a 'target set,' we consider the problem of finding a subset of the source set, called representatives or exemplars, that can efficiently describe the target set. We formulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem. Since the proposed formulation is, in general, NP-hard, we consider a convex relaxation. The solution of our optimization finds representatives and the assignment of each element of the target set to each representative, hence, obtaining a clustering. We analyze the solution of our proposed optimization as a function of the regularization parameter. We show that when the two sets jointly partition into multiple groups, our algorithm finds representatives from all groups and reveals clustering of the sets. In addition, we show that the proposed framework can effectively deal with outliers. Our algorithm works with arbitrary dissimilarities, which can be asymmetric or violate the triangle inequality. To efficiently implement our algorithm, we consider an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in quadratic complexity in the problem size. We show that the ADMM implementation allows to parallelize the algorithm, hence further reducing the computational time. Finally, by experiments on real-world datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm improves the state of the art on the two problems of scene categorization using representative images and time-series modeling and segmentation using representative models."

    "title": "Time-sensitive recommendation from recurrent user activities",
    "abstract": "By making personalized suggestions, a recommender system is playing a crucial role in improving the engagement of users in modern web-services. However, most recommendation algorithms do not explicitly take into account the temporal behavior and the recurrent activities of users. Two central but less explored questions are how to recommend the most desirable item at the right moment, and how to predict the next returning time of a user to a service. To address these questions, we propose a novel framework which connects self-exciting point processes and low-rank models to capture the recurrent temporal patterns in a large collection of user-item consumption pairs. We show that the parameters of the model can be estimated via a convex optimization, and furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm that maintains O(1/\u220a) convergence rate, scales up to problems with millions of user-item pairs and hundreds of millions of temporal events. Compared to other state-of-the-arts in both synthetic and real datasets, our model achieves superb predictive performance in the two time-sensitive recommendation tasks. Finally, we point out that our formulation can incorporate other extra context information of users, such as profile, textual and spatial features."

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings. Moreover, traditional recommender systems consider only the rating information, resulting in the loss of flexibility. Tagging has recently emerged as a popular way for users to annotate, organize and share resources on the Web. Several research tasks have shown that tags can represent userspsila judgments about Web contents quite accurately. In the light of the facts that both the rating activity and tagging activity can reflect userspsila opinions, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach called TagRec based on a unified probabilistic matrix factorization by utilizing both userspsila tagging information and rating information. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets. Furthermore, experimental results on MovieLens data set show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches."

But when new users join the system, the unavailability of information about these users, referred to as cold-start, inhibits the functionality of a recommender system. We propose an enhancement to the user-based approaches, which are extensively used in the recommender system literature. Our approach combines Wikipedia data and browsing history into the recommendation algorithm. Specifically, we generate topics by using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models on the Wikipedia data, and then use the topics on user browsing history to extract user preferences. Our evaluation employs five approaches and tests their performance in terms of prediction and classification accuracy. We conduct experiments in two domains (movies and restaurants), to gather user ratings and their browsing history for evaluation. Results from both experiments favor our proposed enhancement."

This study assesses the impact of an inpatient computerized physician order entry system on prescribing practices.A time series analysis was performed at an urban academic medical center at which all adult inpatient orders are entered through a computerized system. When physicians enter drug orders, the computer displays drug use guidelines, offers relevant alternatives, and suggests appropriate doses and frequencies.For medication selection, use of a computerized guideline resulted in a change in use of the recommended drug (nizatidine) from 15.6% of all histamine(2)-blocker orders to 81.3% (P<.001). Implementation of dose selection menus resulted in a decrease in the SD of drug doses by 11% (P<.001). The proportion of doses that exceeded the recommended maximum decreased from 2.1% before order entry to 0.6% afterward (P<.001). Display of a recommended frequency for ondansetron hydrochloride administration resulted in an increase in the use of the approved frequency from 6% of all ondansetron orders to 75% (P<.001). The use of subcutaneous heparin sodium to prevent thrombosis in patients at bed rest increased from 24% to 47% when the computer suggested this option (P<.001).

    "abstract": "As one promising way to solve the challenging issues of data sparsity and cold start in recommender systems, crossdomain recommendation has gained increasing research interest recently. Cross-domain recommendation aims to improve the recommendation performance by means of transferring explicit or implicit feedback from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. Although the side information of review texts and item contents has been proven to be useful in recommendation, most existing works only use one kind of side information and cannot deeply fuse this side information with ratings. In this paper, we propose a Review and Content based Deep Fusion Model named RC-DFM for crossdomain recommendation. We first extend Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE) to effectively fuse review texts and item contents with the rating matrix in both auxiliary and target domains. Through this way, the learned latent factors of users and items in both domains preserve more semantic information for recommendation. Then we utilize a multi-layer perceptron to transfer user latent factors between the two domains to address the data sparsity and cold start issues. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RC-DFM compared with state-of-the-art recommendation methods.Deeply Fusing Reviews and Contents for Cold Start Users in Cross-Domain Recommendation Systems"

The usage of tailored health messages to support quitting has been proved to increase quitting success rates. Technology can provide convenient means to deliver tailored health messages. Health recommender systems are information-filtering algorithms that can choose the most relevant health-related items\u2014for instance, motivational messages aimed at smoking cessation\u2014for each user based on his or her profile. The goals of this study are to analyze the perceived quality of an mHealth recommender system aimed at smoking cessation, and to assess the level of engagement with the messages delivered to users via this medium. Patients participating in a smoking cessation program will be provided with a mobile app to receive tailored motivational health messages selected by a health recommender system, based on their profile retrieved from an electronic health record as the initial knowledge source. Patients' feedback on the messages and their interactions with the app will be analyzed and evaluated following an observational prospective methodology to a) assess the perceived quality of the mobile-based health recommender system and the messages, using the precision and time-to-read metrics and an 18-item questionnaire delivered to all patients who complete the program, and b) measure patient engagement with the mobile-based health recommender system using aggregated data analytic metrics like session frequency and, to determine the individual-level engagement, the rate of read messages for each user. This paper details the implementation and evaluation protocol that will be followed. This study will explore whether a health recommender system algorithm integrated with an electronic health record can predict which tailored motivational health messages patients would prefer and consider to be of a good quality, encouraging them to engage with the system. The outcomes of this study will help future researchers design better tailored motivational message-sending recommender systems for smoking cessation to increase patient engagement, reduce attrition, and, as a result, increase the rates of smoking cessation.

    "title": "A recursive prediction algorithm for collaborative filtering recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach for building online recommender systems. The fundamental process of the CF approach is to predict how a user would like to rate a given item based on the ratings of some nearest-neighbor users (user-based CF) or nearest-neighbor items (item-based CF). In the user-based CF approach, for example, the conventional prediction procedure is to find some nearest-neighbor users of the active user who have rated the given item, and then aggregate their rating information to predict the rating for the given item. In reality, due to the data sparseness, we have observed that a large proportion of users are filtered out because they don't rate the given item, even though they are very close to the active user. In this paper we present a recursive prediction algorithm, which allows those nearest-neighbor users to join the prediction process even if they have not rated the given item. In our approach, if a required rating value is not provided explicitly by the user, we predict it recursively and then integrate it into the prediction process. We study various strategies of selecting nearest-neighbor users for this recursive process. Our experiments show that the recursive prediction algorithm is a promising technique for improving the prediction accuracy for collaborative filtering recommender systems."

The research falls into three major categories: (a) the need for recommender systems, (b) proposed recommender systems, and (c) implemented recommender systems. From the literature, we found that research has been conducted in seven areas of MOOCs: courses, threads, peers, learning elements, MOOC provider/teacher recommender, student performance recommender, and others. To date, the research has mostly focused on the implementation of recommender systems, particularly course recommender systems. Areas for future research and implementation include design of practical and scalable online recommender systems, design of a recommender system for MOOC provider and teacher, and usefulness of recommender systems."

Since the nature of mobile applications differs from classical items to be recommended (e.g. books, movies, other goods), not only can new approaches for recommendation be developed, but also new paradigms for evaluating performance of recommender systems are advisable. During the lifecycle of mobile applications, different events can be observed that provide insights into users' engagement with particular applications. This gives rise to new approaches for evaluation of recommender systems.

Challenging issues in their research agenda include the sparsity of user preference data and the lack of flexibility to incorporate contextual factors in the recommendation methods. To a significant extent, these issues can be related to a limited description and exploitation of the semantics underlying both user and item representations. The authors propose a three-fold knowledge representation, in which an explicit, semantic-rich domain knowledge space is incorporated between user and item spaces. The enhanced semantics support the development of contextualisation capabilities and enable performance improvements in recommendation methods. As a proof of concept and evaluation testbed, the approach is evaluated through its implementation in a news recommender system, in which it is tested with real users. In such scenario, semantic knowledge bases and item annotations are automatically produced from public sources."

We seek to protect the privacy interests of customers by trying to keep private their identity and demographic characteristics, and possibly also their buying preferences and behaviour. This can be desirable even if anonymity is used. Furthermore, we want to protect the commercial interests of the e-commerce service providers by allowing them to make recommendations as accurate as possible, without unnecessarily revealing valuable information they have legitimately accumulated, such as market trends, to third parties.In this paper, we concentrate on recommender systems based on demographic filtering, which make recommendations based on feedback of previous users of similar demographic characteristics (such as age, sex, level of education, wealth, geographical location, etc.). We propose a system called ALAMBIC, which adequately achieves the above privacy-protection objectives in this kind of recommender systems. Our system is based on a semi-trusted third party in which the users need only have limited confidence. A main originality of our approach is to split user data between that party and the service provider in such a way that neither can derive sensitive information from their share alone."

The system provides recommendations for approximately 160 million English research papers and patents. Our approach handles incomplete citation information while also alleviating the cold-start problem that often affects other recommender systems. We use the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), titles, and available abstracts of research papers to build a recommendation list for all documents, thereby combining co-citation and content based approaches. Tuning system parameters also allows for blending and prioritization of each approach which, in turn, allows us to balance paper novelty versus authority in recommendation results. We evaluate the generated recommendations via a user study of 40 participants, with over 2400 recommendation pairs graded and discuss the quality of the results using P@10 and nDCG scores. We see that there is a strong correlation between participant scores and the similarity rankings produced by our system but that additional focus needs to be put towards improving recommender precision, particularly for content based recommendations. The results of the user survey and associated analysis scripts are made available via GitHub and the recommendations produced by our system are available as part of the MAG on Azure to facilitate further research and light up novel research paper recommendation applications."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are powerful online tools that help to overcome problems of information overload. They make personalized recommendations to online users using various data mining and filtering techniques. However, most of the existing recommender systems use a single rating to represent the preference of user on an item. These techniques have several limitations as the preference of the user towards items may depend on several attributes of the items. Multi-criteria recommender systems extend the single rating recommendation techniques to incorporate multiple criteria ratings for improving recommendation accuracy. However, modeling the criteria ratings in multi-criteria recommender systems to determine the overall preferences of users has been considered as one of the major challenges in multi-criteria recommender systems. In other words, how to additionally take the multi-criteria rating information into account during the recommendation process is one of the problems of multi-criteria recommender systems. This article presents a methodological framework that trains artificial neural networks with particle swarm optimization algorithms and uses the neural networks for integrating the multi-criteria rating information and determining the preferences of users. The proposed neural network-based multi-criteria recommender system is integrated with k-nearest neighborhood collaborative filtering for predicting unknown criteria ratings. The proposed approach has been tested with a multi-criteria dataset for recommending movies to users. The empirical results of the study show that the proposed model has a higher prediction accuracy than the corresponding traditional recommendation technique and other multi-criteria recommender systems."

    "abstract": "Broadcast media are declining in their power to decide which issues and viewpoints will reach large audiences. But new information filters are appearing, in the guise of recommender systems, aggregators, search engines, feed ranking algorithms, and the sites we bookmark and the people and organizations we choose to follow on Twitter. Sometimes we explicitly choose our filters; some we hardly even notice. Critics worry that, collectively, these filters will isolate people in information bubbles only partly of their own choosing, and that the inaccurate beliefs they form as a result may be difficult to correct. But should we really be worried, and, if so, what can we do about it? Our panelists will review what scholars know about selectivity of exposure preferences and actual exposure and what we in the CSCW field can do to develop and test ways of promoting diverse exposure, openness to the diversity we actually encounter, and deliberative discussion."

    "title": "Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "As the business needs are accelerating, there is an increased dependence on extracting meaningful information from humongous amount of raw data to drive business solutions. The same is true for digital recommendation systems which are becoming a norm for consumer industries such as books, music, clothing, movies, news articles, places, utilities, etc. These systems collect information from the users to improve the future suggestions. This paper aims to describe the implementation of a movie recommender system via two collaborative filtering algorithms using Apache Mahout. Furthermore, this paper will also focus on analyzing the data to gain insights into the movie dataset using Matplotlib libraries in Python."

    "title": "Non-Negativity Constrained Missing Data Estimation for High-Dimensional and Sparse Matrices from Industrial Applications",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices are commonly seen in big-data-related industrial applications like recommender systems. Latent factor (LF) models have proven to be accurate and efficient in extracting hidden knowledge from them. However, they mostly fail to fulfill the non-negativity constraints that describe the non-negative nature of many industrial data. Moreover, existing models suffer from slow convergence rate. An alternating-direction-method of multipliers-based non-negative LF (AMNLF) model decomposes the task of non-negative LF analysis on an HiDS matrix into small subtasks, where each task is solved based on the latest solutions to the previously solved ones, thereby achieving fast convergence and high prediction accuracy for its missing data. This paper theoretically analyzes the characteristics of an AMNLF model, and presents detailed empirical studies regarding its performance on nine HiDS matrices from industrial applications currently in use. Therefore, its capability of addressing HiDS matrices is justified in both theory and practice."

    "title": "HeteroMF",
    "abstract": "With the growing amount of information available online, recommender systems are starting to provide a viable alternative and complement to search engines, in helping users to find objects of interest. Methods based on Matrix Factorization (MF) models are the state-of-the-art in recommender systems. The input to MF is user feedback, in the form of a rating matrix. However, users can be engaged in interactions with multiple types of entities across different contexts, leading to multiple rating matrices. In other words, users can have interactions in a heterogeneous information network. Generally, in a heterogeneous network, entities from any two entity types can have interactions with a weight (rating) indicating the level of endorsement. Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) has been proposed to address the recommendation problem in heterogeneous networks. However, a main issue with CMF is that entities share the same latent factor across different contexts. This is particularly problematic in two cases: Latent factors for entities that are cold-start in a context will be learnt mainly based on the data from other contexts where these entities are not cold-start, and therefore the factors are not properly learned for the cold-start context. Also, if a context has more data compared to another context, then the dominant context will dominate the learning process for the latent factors for entities shared in these two contexts. In this paper, we propose a context-dependent matrix factorization model, HeteroMF, that considers a general latent factor for entities of every entity type and context-dependent latent factors for every context in which the entities are involved. We learn a general latent factor for every entity and transfer matrices for every context to convert the general latent factors into a context-dependent latent factor. Experiments on two real life datasets from Epinions and Flixster demonstrate that HeteroMF substantially outperforms CMF, particularly for cold-start entities and for contexts where interactions in one contexts are dominated by other contexts."

    "abstract": "Text analytics systems often rely heavily on detecting and linking entity mentions in documents to knowledge bases for downstream applications such as sentiment analysis, question answering and recommender systems. A major challenge for this task is to be able to accurately detect entities in new languages with limited labeled resources. In this paper we present an accurate and lightweight, multilingual named entity recognition (NER) and linking (NEL) system. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1) Lightweight named entity recognition with competitive accuracy; 2) Candidate entity retrieval that uses search click-log data and entity embeddings to achieve high precision with a low memory footprint; and 3) efficient entity disambiguation. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAC KBP 2013 multilingual data and on English AIDA CONLL data."

    "title": "Research Strategies for Safety Evaluation of Nanomaterials. Part VI. Characterization of Nanoscale Particles for Toxicological Evaluation",
    "abstract": "To properly assign mechanisms or causes for toxic effects of nanoscale materials, their properties and characteristics both outside and within the biological environment must be well understood. Scientists have many tools for studying the size, shape, and surface properties of particulates outside of the physiological environment; however, it is difficult to measure many of these same properties in situ without perturbing the environment, leading to spurious findings. Characterizing nanoparticle systems in situ can be further complicated by an organism's active clearance, defense, and/or immune responses. As toxicologists begin to examine nanomaterials in a systematic fashion, there is consensus that a series of guidelines or recommended practices is necessary for basic characterization of nanomaterials. These recommended practices should be developed jointly by physical scientists skilled in nano characterization and biological scientists experienced in toxicology research. In this article, basic nanoparticle characterization techniques are discussed, along with the some of the issues and implications associated with measuring nanoparticle properties and their interactions with biological systems. Recommendations regarding how best to approach nanomaterial characterization include using proper sampling and measurement techniques, forming multidisciplinary teams, and making measurements as close to the biological action point as possible."

    "abstract": "Abstract Offline evaluation is an essential complement to online experiments in the selection, improvement, tuning, and deployment of recommender systems. Offline methodologies for recommender system evaluation evolved from experimental practice in Machine Learning (ML) and Information Retrieval (IR). However, evaluating recommendations involves particularities that pose challenges to the assumptions upon which the ML and IR methodologies were developed. We recap and reflect on the development and current status of recommender system evaluation, providing an updated perspective. With a focus on offline evaluation, we review the adaptation of IR principles, procedures and metrics, and the implications of those techniques when applied to recommender systems. At the same time, we identify the singularities of recommendation that require different responses, or involve specific new needs. In addition, we provide an overview of important choices in the configuration of experiments that require particular care and understanding; discuss broader perspectives of evaluation such as recommendation value beyond accuracy; and survey open challenges such as experimental biases, and the cyclic dimension of recommendation."

    "abstract": "Abstract This special issue examines the growing importance of algorithms and automation in the gathering, composition, and distribution of news. It connects a long line of research on journalism and computation with scholarly and professional terrain yet to be explored. Taken as a whole, these articles share some of the noble ambitions of the pioneering publications on \u2018reporting algorithms\u2019, such as a desire to see computing help journalists in their watchdog role by holding power to account. However, they also go further, firstly by addressing the fuller range of technologies that computational journalism now consists of: from chatbots and recommender systems, to artificial intelligence and atomised journalism. Secondly, they advance the literature by demonstrating the increased variety of uses for these technologies, including engaging underserved audiences, selling subscriptions, and recombining and re-using content. Thirdly, they problematize computational journalism by, for example, pointing out some of the challenges inherent in applying AI to investigative journalism and in trying to preserve public service values. Fourthly, they offer suggestions for future research and practice, including by presenting a framework for developing democratic news recommenders and another that may help us think about computational journalism in a more integrated, structured manner."

    "title": "Extended Latent Class Models for Collaborative Recommendation",
    "abstract": "With the advent of the World Wide Web, providing just-in-time personalized product recommendations to customers now becomes possible. Collaborative recommender systems utilize correlation between customer preference ratings to identify \"like-minded\" customers and predict their product preference. One factor determining the success of the recommender systems is the prediction accuracy, which in many cases is limited by lacking adequate ratings (the sparsity problem). Recently, the use of latent class model (LCM) has been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we first study how the LCM can be extended to handle customers and products outside the training set. In addition, we propose the use of a pair of LCMs (called dual latent class model-DLCM), instead of a single LCM, to model customers' likes and dislikes separately for enhancing the prediction accuracy. Experimental results based on the EachMovie dataset show that DLCM outperforms both LCM and the conventional correlation-based method when the available ratings are sparse."

    "abstract": "Recommender system suggests a personalized recommendation by filtering the information based on users interest. Nowadays, users like to purchase the best possible items and services to spend the shortest span of time. The cross-domain recommendation system is a method of recommendation wherein knowledge is gathered from multiple domains. With respect to the user's search term from the source domain, most similar items are recommended from the target domain. Semantic similarity between two different items can be achieved through Wpath method using Ontology. PrefixSpan is used for generating sequential patterns and Topseq rule mining algorithm is used for finding the frequent sequential rule. So, this work tries to extend cross domain recommendation by 1) finding the semantic similarity of items using Ontology; 2) applying Collaborative Filtering for finding similar items and users; 3) generating frequent item sequences using PrefixSpan sequential pattern mining algorithm and 4) recommending user preferred items using Topseq rule mining algorithm. The recommender system is evaluated considering precision, recall and F1 Score measures. It finds CD-SPM which yields better F1 Score. The proposed approach also alleviates the new user problem and sparsity problem to some extent."

    "title": "Quality Indicators for Colonoscopy",
    "abstract": "ACG: American College of Gastroenterology; ADR: adenoma detection rate; APC: adenoma per colonoscopy; ASGE: American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; CRC: colorectal cancer; PDR: polyp detection rate Colonoscopy is widely used for the diagnosis and treatment of colon disorders. Properly performed, colonoscopy is generally safe, accurate, and well-tolerated. Visualization of the mucosa of the entire large intestine and distal terminal ileum usually is possible during colonoscopy. Polyps can be removed during colonoscopy, thereby reducing the risk of colon cancer. Colonoscopy is the preferred method to evaluate the colon in most adult patients with large-bowel symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, abnormal results on radiographic studies of the colon, positive results on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening tests, post-polypectomy and post-cancer resection surveillance, and diagnosis and surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, colonoscopy is the most commonly used CRC screening test in the United States (1). Based on 2010 data, over 3.3 million outpatient colonoscopies are performed annually in the United States, with screening and polyp surveillance accounting for half of indications (2). Optimal effectiveness of colonoscopy depends on patient acceptance of the procedure, which depends mostly on acceptance of the bowel preparation (3). Preparation quality affects the completeness of examination, procedure duration, and the need to cancel or repeat procedures at earlier dates than would otherwise be needed (4, 5). Ineffective preparation is a major contributor to costs (6). Meticulous inspection (7, 8) and longer withdrawal times (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) are associated with higher adenoma detection rates (ADR). A high ADR is essential to rendering recommended intervals (15) between screening and surveillance examinations safe (16, 17). Optimal technique is needed to ensure a high probability of detecting dysplasia when present in inflammatory bowel disease (17, 18, 19, 20, 21). Finally, technical expertise and experience will help prevent adverse events that might offset the benefits of removing neoplastic lesions (22). Recent studies report that colonoscopy is less effective in preventing proximal colon cancer and cancer deaths (ie, colon cancer proximal to the splenic flexure) compared with distal cancer (ie, colon cancer at or distal to the splenic flexure) (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28). Decreased protection against right-sided CRC is likely due to multiple factors. These include missed adenomas or incompletely resected adenomas; suboptimal bowel preparation; precancerous lesions that are endoscopically subtle or difficult to remove, such as sessile serrated polyps and flat and/or depressed adenomas, and differences in tumorigenesis between right-sided and left-sided cancers. Improving prevention of right-sided colon cancer is a major goal of colonoscopy quality programs. Five studies have established that gastroenterologists are more effective than surgeons or primary care physicians at preventing CRC by colonoscopy (27, 29, 30, 31, 32). This most likely reflects higher rates of complete examinations (ie, cecal intubation) (30) and higher rates of adenoma detection among gastroenterologists (33, 34). All endoscopists performing colonoscopy should measure the quality of their colonoscopy. Institutions where endoscopists from multiple specialties are practicing should reasonably expect all endoscopists to participate in the program and achieve recommended quality benchmarks. The quality of health care can be measured by comparing the performance of an individual or a group of individuals with an ideal or benchmark (35). The particular parameter that is being used for comparison is termed a quality indicator. A quality indicator often is reported as a ratio between the incidence of correct performance and the opportunity for correct performance (4) or as the proportion of interventions that achieve a predefined goal (35). Quality indicators can be divided into 3 categories: (1) structural measures\u2014these assess characteristics of the entire health care environment (eg, participation by a physician or other clinician in systematic clinical database registry that includes consensus endorsed quality measures), (2) process measures\u2014these assess performance during the delivery of care (eg, ADR and adequate biopsy sampling during colonoscopy for chronic ulcerative colitis), (3) outcome measures\u2014these assess the results of the care that was provided (eg, the prevention of cancer by colonoscopy and reduction in the incidence of colonoscopic perforation). METHODOLOGY In 2006, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE)/American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Task Force on Quality in Endoscopy published their first version of quality indicators for colonoscopy (36). The present update integrates new data pertaining to previously proposed quality indicators and new quality indicators for performing colonoscopy (36). Indicators that had wide-ranging clinical application, were associated with variation in practice and outcomes, and were validated in clinical studies were prioritized. Clinical studies were identified through a computerized search of Medline followed by review of the bibliographies of all relevant articles. When such studies were absent, indicators were chosen by expert consensus. Although feasibility of measurement was a consideration, it is hoped that inclusion of highly relevant, but not yet easily measurable indicators, would promote their eventual adoption. Although a comprehensive list of quality indicators is proposed, it is recognized that, ultimately, only a small subset might be widely used for continuous quality improvement, benchmarking, or quality reporting. As in 2006, the current task force concentrated its attention on parameters related to endoscopic procedures; whereas the quality of care delivered to patients is clearly influenced by many factors related to the facilities in which endoscopy is performed, characterization of unit-related quality indicators was not included in the scope of this effort. The resultant quality indicators were graded on the strength of the supporting evidence (Table 1). Each quality indicator was classified as an outcome or a process measure. Although outcome quality indicators are preferred, some can be difficult to measure in routine clinical practice, because they need analysis of large amounts of data and long-term follow-up and may be confounded by other factors. In such cases, the task force deemed it reasonable to use process indicators as surrogate measures of high-quality endoscopy. The relative value of a process indicator hinges on the evidence that supports its association with a clinically relevant outcome, and such process measures were emphasized.Table 1: Grades of recommendationaThe quality indicators for this update were written in a manner that lends them to be developed as measures. Although they remain quality indicators and not measures, this document also contains a list of performance targets for each quality indicator. The task force selected performance targets from benchmarking data in the literature when available. When no data were available to support establishing a performance target level, \u201cN/A\u201d (not available) was listed. However, when expert consensus considered failure to perform a given quality indicator a \u201cnever event\u201d such as monitoring vital signs during sedation, then the performance target was listed as >98%. It is important to emphasize that the performance targets listed do not necessarily reflect the standard of care but rather serve as specific goals to direct quality improvement efforts. Quality indicators were divided into 3 time periods: pre-procedure, intraprocedure, and postprocedure. For each category, key relevant research questions were identified. In order to guide continuous quality improvement efforts, the task force also recommended a high-priority subset of the indicators described, based on their clinical relevance and importance, evidence that performance varies significantly in clinical practice, and feasibility of measurement (a function of the number of procedures needed to obtain an accurate measurement with narrow confidence intervals and the ease of measurement). A useful approach for an individual endoscopist is to first measure their performances with regard to these priority indicators. Quality improvement efforts would move to different quality indicators if the endoscopists are performing above recommended thresholds, or the employer and/ or teaching center could institute corrective measures and remeasure performance of low-level performers. Recognizing that certain quality indicators are common to all GI endoscopic procedures, such items are presented in detail in a separate document, similar to the process in 20 06 (37, 38). The preprocedure, intraprocedure, and postprocedure indicators common to all endoscopy are listed in Table 2. Those common factors will be discussed in this document only insofar as the discussion needs to be modified specifically to relate to colonoscopy.Table 2: Summary of proposed quality indicators common to all endoscopic procedures (38)aPreprocedure quality indicators The preprocedure period includes all contacts between members of the endoscopy team and the patient before the administration of sedation or insertion of the endoscope. Common issues for all endoscopic procedures during this period include: appropriate indication, informed consent, risk assessment, formulation of a sedation plan, management of prophylactic antibiotics and antithrombotic drugs, and timeliness of the procedure (38). Preprocedure quality indicators specific to performance of colonoscopy include the following: 1. Frequency with which colonoscopy is performed for an indication that is included in a published standard list of appropriate indications, and the indication is documented Level of evidence: 1C+ Performance target: >80% Type of measure: process The ASGE has published appropriate indications for colonoscopy (Table 3) (39). An appropriate indication should be documented for each procedure, and when it is a nonstandard indication, it should be justified in the documentation. When performing colonoscopy for average-risk CRC screening or colon polyp surveillance, endoscopists should specifically document whether the patient had a colonoscopy previously, date of the last colonoscopy (or document that the date of that procedure is not available), and any histologic findings from polyps removed during that colonoscopy.Table 3: Appropriate indications for colonoscopy (39)Discussion: In 2012, the ASGE updated its indications for endoscopic procedures (39). This list was determined by a review of published literature and expert consensus. Studies have shown that when colonoscopy is done for appropriate reasons, significantly more clinically relevant diagnoses are made (40, 41, 42). In these studies, which divided indications into appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate and looked at high-volume European centers, 21 to 39% were classified as inappropriate. It is likely that this can be improved to a <20% inappropriate rate (43). The European Panel on the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Internet guideline is a useful decision support tool for determining the appropriateness of colonoscopy (43). The goal is to minimize the number of inappropriate procedures (44, 45, 46). 2. Frequency with which informed consent is obtained, including specific discussions of risks associated with colonoscopy, and fully documented Level of evidence: 1C Performance target: >98% Type of measure: process In addition to the risks associated with all endoscopic procedures, the consent should address the relevant and substantial adverse events pertaining to each specific colonoscopy procedure. Discussion: As with all other endoscopic procedures, consent must be obtained before the procedure from the patient or guardian (or as required by local law or per policy of the institution). It must include a discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure. The most common risks of colonoscopy include bleeding, perforation, infection, sedation-related adverse events, missed lesions, and intravenous site adverse events. 3. Frequency with which colonoscopies follow recommended post-polypectomy and post-cancer resection surveillance intervals and 10-year intervals between screening colonoscopies in average-risk patients who have negative examination results and adequate bowel cleansing (priority indicator) Level of evidence: 1A Performance target: \u226590% Type of measure: process Discussion: For colonoscopy to be both effective and cost-effective and to minimize risk, the intervals between examinations should be optimized. Intervals between examinations can be effective in prevention of incident CRC only when the colon is effectively cleared of neoplasia. Therefore, detailed and effective examination of the colon, as discussed in the following, is critical to the effectiveness and safety of recommended intervals between colonoscopy. The recommended intervals assume cecal intubation, adequate bowel preparation, and careful examination. In the average-risk population (persons aged \u226550 years without other risk factors for CRC or who have only one first-degree relative with CRC and that cancer was diagnosed at age >60 years), colonoscopic screening is recommended in all past and current guidelines at 10-year intervals (15, 47, 48). A German case-control study found that a negative screening colonoscopy result was associated with >20 years of protection against colorectal cancer (49). In cohorts of average-risk persons who underwent an initial colonoscopy with a negative result, a repeat colonoscopy 5 years later had a very low yield (50, 51). Two studies of flexible sigmoidoscopy found a protective effect of endoscopy with polypectomy lasting 10 years and 16 years and could not exclude longer durations of protection (52, 53). Thus, although colonoscopy is not perfectly protective, its protective effect is prolonged. These data support the 10-year interval, but many American colonoscopists systematically perform screening colonoscopy at 5-year intervals in average-risk individuals (54). This practice is not cost-effective, exposes patients to excess risk, and cannot be justified. When performing colonoscopy for CRC screening, endoscopists should document under \u201cindication for procedure\u201d whether the patient previously had a colonoscopy, date of the last colonoscopy, and any histologic findings from polyps removed during that colonoscopy if that information is available. This documentation should demonstrate that colonoscopy for CRC screening or colon polyp surveillance is being performed at an appropriate interval. Evidence from surveys indicates that post-polypectomy surveillance colonoscopy in the United States is frequently performed at intervals that are shorter than those recommended in guidelines (55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60), that knowledge of guideline recommendations is high, and lack of guideline awareness is unlikely to account for overuse of colonoscopy. Assessments of actual practice identified both overuse of surveillance examination in low-risk patients and underuse in high-risk patients (61). An assessment of Medicare colonoscopy codes demonstrated systematic overuse of colonoscopy for screening and post-polypectomy surveillance by some physicians (54). These surveys underscore the importance of measuring intervals between examinations in continuous quality improvement programs. Surgeons were more likely to use short intervals than were gastroenterologists (55), emphasizing the need for all specialties practicing colonoscopy to participate in quality programs. Primary care and other referring physicians can reasonably expect surveillance recommendations to reflect post-polypectomy surveillance recommendations or to be accompanied by an explanation indicating why the recommended interval differs from the guideline. Intervals between examinations are recommended based on the best available evidence and experience that indicates a balance between the protective effect of high-quality clearing colonoscopy with the risks and cost of colonoscopy. Intervals are determined by the numbers, size, and specific histology of precancerous lesions (15). Patients with sessile polyps >2 cm in size that are removed piecemeal have a high risk for residual polyp at the polypectomy site and require short-term follow-up at 3 to 6 months (15) and a second examination a year later to rule out a late recurrence of polyp at the site (62). Recommended post-polypectomy surveillance intervals for sessile serrated polyps (also called sessile serrated adenomas) and traditional serrated adenomas currently are based on limited evidence and will be subject to updating as new evidence appears (15). Serrated lesions include hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated polyps, and traditional serrated adenomas. Serrated lesions, particularly the sessile serrated polyp, are considered the precursors of a substantial group of CRCs that arise predominantly in the proximal colon. At this time, consensus post-polypectomy surveillance intervals for sessile serrated polyps are similar to recommended intervals for adenomas and are based on size and number of lesions (15). Serrated lesions of all types should be counted to identify patients who meet the criteria for serrated polyposis, formerly known as hyperplastic polyposis syndrome, for which colonoscopy is recommended at 1 to 2-year intervals (15). Patients who have suspected colon bleeding after a negative colonoscopy result may require repeat examinations at intervals shorter than those recommended. However, the use of fecal occult blood testing by using guaiac-based tests for the first 5 years after a colonoscopy is inappropriate because the positive predictive value of guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing during that interval is extremely low (63). Additional study of fecal immunochemical testing for blood in this setting as an adjunct to colonoscopy is warranted (64). Colonoscopies performed for screening or surveillance at intervals shorter than those recommended in guidelines and without an appropriate explanation for the shortened interval should be considered to have an inappropriate indication. 4. Frequency with which ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis surveillance is recommended within proper intervals Level of evidence: 2C Performance target: \u226590% Type of measure: process Discussion: In ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, surveillance refers to interval examinations in patients with long-standing disease who have undergone an initial examination in which dysplasia was not detected. The term also is used when patients who are asymptomatic are prospectively entered into interval colonoscopy programs based on the duration of disease. Surveillance does not refer to diagnostic examinations or examinations in previously diagnosed patients to assess symptoms. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis of long duration are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (65, 66). Surveillance colonoscopy often is recommended beginning 7 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms when ulcerative colitis extends beyond the rectum or in Crohn's disease when more than one third of the colon is involved. There are no randomized trials to support the effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis, but case-control studies in ulcerative colitis indicate a survival benefit for patients who participate in surveillance (67, 68). Surveys of practitioners in the United States (69) and the United Kingdom (70) demonstrate that many practitioners are not familiar with surveillance recommendations, have a poor understanding of dysplasia, and make inappropriate recommendations in response to findings of dysplasia (69, 70). Patients should undergo surveillance colonoscopy, which has emerged as a standard of medical care in the United States. The onset of disease is considered to be the onset of symptoms for the purpose of initiating surveillance for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis. Because the yield of dysplasia or cancer during ulcerative colitis surveillance is relatively low and not cost-effective (71), it is important to avoid overuse of surveillance colonoscopy during the first 20 years (72). At between 7 and 20 years of disease, intervals of 2 to 3 years are generally adequate, assuming the absence of primary sclerosing cholangitis and a colon that is without severe scarring (71). Indeed, recent studies continue to indicate that the risk for CRC in chronic ulcerative colitis has been overestimated in previous decades (18, 73). Shorter intervals between examinations are indicated for patients with long-duration disease and may be initiated earlier in the course of disease in patients with established risk modifiers, such as a family history of CRC or a personal history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (71). Persons with primary sclerosing cholangitis who are discovered to have asymptomatic ulcerative colitis should begin surveillance at the time ulcerative colitis is diagnosed. Patients with endoscopically abnormal colons (eg, endoscopic scarring, pseudopolyp formation or cobblestoning, chronic severe inflammation) are at increased risk for development of cancer, compared with patients with endoscopically normal colons (74). Thus, patients with endoscopically normal colons, or with only mild abnormalities, can be triaged to longer intervals of surveillance of at least 2 to 3 years, at least during the interval from 7 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms, and assuming the absence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (74). Preprocedure research questions Why do physicians fail to follow recommended guidelines for screening and surveillance intervals? Are they concerned about missed lesions? Is there fear of litigation? What interventions will maximize adherence to guideline recommendations? Which serrated lesions in the proximal colon are clinically important? What are cost-effective intervals for follow-up after removal of sessile serrated polyps and large (>10 mm) hyperplastic polyps? Does the incidence of splenic injury during colonoscopy warrant inclusion in the informed consent process? What is the current understanding among clinicians of surveillance guidelines for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis? How will new reimbursement models affect compliance with recommended surveillance intervals? Can and should surveillance interval recommendations be adjusted for endoscopists with high-level versus low-level baseline ADRs? Does the presence of 3 small adenomas warrant high-risk surveillance for endoscopists with high ADRs? Intraprocedure quality indicators Quality evaluation of the colon consists of intubation of the entire colon and a detailed mucosal inspection. Cecal intubation improves sensitivity and reduces costs by eliminating the need for radiographic procedures or repeat colonoscopy to complete the examination. Careful mucosal inspection is essential to effective CRC prevention and reduction of cancer mortality. The detection of neoplastic lesions is the primary goal of most colonoscopic examinations. Cost-benefit analyses of colonoscopy for the detection of neoplastic lesions are well within acceptable rates (approximately $20,000 per year of life saved) (75). However, adverse events, repeat procedures, and inappropriate surgical intervention for endoscopically removable polyps can reduce this benefit significantly. It is incumbent on endoscopists to evaluate their practices and make improvements wherever possible to reduce the costs associated with neoplasia detection. The intraprocedure period extends from the administration of sedation, or insertion of the endoscope when no sedation is given, to the removal of the endoscope. This period includes all the technical aspects of the procedure including completion of the examination and of therapeutic maneuvers. Common to most endoscopic procedures is the provision of sedation and need for patient monitoring (38). Intraprocedure quality indicators specific to performance of colonoscopy include the following: 5. Frequency with which the procedure note documents the quality of preparation Level of evidence: 3 Performance target: \u226598% Type of measure: process Quality of bowel preparation is based on ability to visualize the mucosa after retained stool and fluid have been suctioned away. Discussion: The endoscopist should document the quality of the bowel preparation in each colonoscopy (76, 77). Terms commonly used to characterize bowel preparation include excellent, good, fair, and poor. In clinical practice, these terms do not have standardized definitions (78). They are given standardized definitions in clinical trials of bowel preparation (79), but these trials often take into account retained fluid, which is of little interest to the examination because it can be readily suctioned. Some practitioners use the terms adequate or inadequate. The ASGE/ACG task force recommends that the examination be considered adequate if it allows detection of (within the technical limitations of the procedure) polyps >5 mm in size (80). Another option is to use independently validated preparation scores, such as the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (81) or the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (82). However, the Ottawa scale also takes into account retained material that can be removed before examination. Regardless of the scoring system used, endoscopists should document the quality of bowel preparation based on ability to identify polyps after retained fluid or stool has been suctioned. If bowel cleansing is inadequate to identify polyps >5 mm in size, and the procedure is being performed for CRC screening or colon polyp surveillance, then the procedure should be repeated in 1 year or less (15). Adequate preparation carries the implication that the recommended interval before the next colonoscopy will be consistent with guidelines (15). Poor bowel preparation is a major impediment to the effectiveness of colonoscopy. Poor preparation prolongs cecal intubation time and withdrawal time and reduces detection of both small (4) and large (4, 5, 83) polyps. In every colonoscopic practice, some colonoscopies must be repeated at intervals shorter than those recommended (15, 84) based on inadequate preparation. The economic burden of repeating examinations because of inadequate bowel preparation is substantial (6). 6. Frequency with which the bowel preparation is adequate to allow the use of recommended surveillance or screening intervals Level of evidence: 3 Performance target: \u226585% of outpatient examinations Type of measure: process We recommend that the percentage of outpatient examinations with inadequate bowel preparation that require repeat colonoscopy in \u22641 year should not exceed 15% (5). Measurement of an individual practitioner\u2019s percentage of examinations requiring repetition because of inadequate preparation is recommended. Endoscopists who have >15% of examinations with inadequate bowel preparation should re-examine their bowel preparation protocols, including patient education, choice of purgative, and protocol for administering the purgative, including use of the split-dose protocol. Recent clinical trials of even low-volume preparations (which have lower effectiveness than 4-liter preparations) suggest that these rates of adequate preparation are readily achievable in outpatients by using split-dose preparation (85, 86). Socioeconomic factors and language barriers in some patient populations may require increased educational efforts before the colonoscopy to achieve this level of success. The most important determinant of preparation quality is the interval between the end of the preparation ingestion and the start of the procedure (87). Quality diminishes as the interval increases, and the right side of the colon is particularly affected. We recommend that all patients be prescribed split-dosing of bowel preparations, meaning that half the preparation is given on the day of the examination (87). For afternoon colonoscopies, the entire preparation can be ingested on the day of examination (88). According to fasting guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, patients should have nothing by mouth for 2 h after ingestion of clear liquids (89). We recommend that rule be followed for ingestion for split-dose and same-day preparations. This recommendation is supported by prospective observational studies that demonstrate that residual volume of liquid in the stomach is minimal (<25 ml) and similar whether patients split the bowel preparation or consume all of the bowel preparation on the evening before the procedure (90). However, because this study (90) excluded patients with gastroparesis, longer intervals may be prudent in those with conditions such as gastroparesis or achalasia (increased risk of larger volumes of retained fluid), those with central nervous system dysfunction that might be more inclined to aspirate, or in those with cardiac, pulmonary, or immunologic disease in whom a small aspiration event might be devastating. Patients should receive instruction to begin the second half of split-dose preparations 4 to 5 h before their scheduled procedure start time, and they should be finished with ingestion by at least 2 h before that time (89). Because the quality of preparation deteriorates as the preparation-to-procedure interval increases, patients scheduled in the early morning (before 9 AM) who refuse to begin ingestion 4 to 5 h before the scheduled time can begin ingestion of the second half of the preparation late on the evening before (aft"

    "abstract": "The online recommendation system has become a trend. Now a days rather than going out and buying items for themselves, reason being, online recommendation provides an easier and quicker way to buy items and transactions are also quick when it is done online. Recommended systems are powerful new technology and it helps users to find items which they want to buy. A recommendation system is broadly used to recommend products to the end users that are most appropriate. Online book selling Web sites now-a-days is competing with each other by considering many attributes. A recommendation system is one of the strongest tools to increase profits and retaining buyer. The existing systems lead to extraction of irrelevant information and lead to lack of user satisfaction. This paper presents Book Recommendation System (BRS) based on combined features of content based filtering (CBF), collaborative filtering (CF) and association rule mining to produce efficient and effective recommendation. For this we are proposing a hybrid algorithm in which we combine two or more algorithms, so it helps the recommendation system to recommend the book based on the buyer's interest."

    "abstract": "How do news organizations design and implement algorithmically personalized news services? We conducted 16 in-depth interviews with professionals working in European public service broadcasting and commercial quality news media to answer this question. The news business is undergoing rapid transformations regarding how news production is financed, how news is produced and delivered to audiences and how citizens consume news. In all of these changes algorithmic recommender systems play a role. We focus on news organizations' own personalized news services, and analyze how they define the role of personalization in contributing to the financial success of the organization, in reaching and retaining audiences, and in fulfilling their editorial mission. We interviewed editors, journalists, technologists and business intelligence and publishing professionals to gain a structural understanding of the often conflicting goals of personalization. We found that rather than focusing on increasing short-term user engagement, European quality news media try to use news personalization to increase long-term audience loyalty. In distinction to the \"platform logic of personalization\", which uses personalization to produce engagement and sell audiences to advertisers, they have developed a \"news logic of personalization\", which uses personalization to sell news to audiences."

    "abstract": "Given the vast amount of information on the World Wide Web, recommender systems are increasingly being used to help filter irrelevant data and suggest information that would interest users. Traditional systems make recommendations based on a single domain e.g., movie or book domain. Recent work has examined the correlations in different domains and designed models that exploit user preferences on a source domain to predict user preferences on a target domain. However, these methods are based on matrix factorization and can only be applied to two-dimensional data. Transferring high dimensional data from one domain to another requires decomposing the high dimensional data to binary relations which results in information loss."

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems have been playing essential roles in e-commerce portals. Existing recommendation algorithms usually learn the ranking scores of items by optimizing a single task (e.g. Click-through rate prediction) based on users' historical click sequences, but they generally pay few attention to simultaneously modeling users' multiple types of behaviors or jointly optimize multiple objectives (e.g. both Click-through rate and Conversion rate), which are both vital for e-commerce sites. In this paper, we argue that it is crucial to formulate users' different interests based on multiple types of behaviors and perform multi-task learning for significant improvement in multiple objectives simultaneously. We propose Deep Multifaceted Transformers (DMT), a novel framework that can model users' multiple types of behavior sequences simultaneously with multiple Transformers. It utilizes Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts to optimize multiple objectives. Besides, it exploits unbiased learning to reduce the selection bias in the training data. Experiments on JD real production dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DMT, which significantly outperforms state-of-art methods. DMT has been successfully deployed to serve the main traffic in the commercial Recommender System in JD.com.

    "abstract": "As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?"

With a careful setup of a vanilla matrix factorization baseline, we are not only able to improve upon the reported results for this baseline but even outperform the reported results of any newly proposed method. Secondly, we recap the tremendous effort that was required by the community to obtain high quality results for simple methods on the Netflix Prize. Our results indicate that empirical findings in research papers are questionable unless they were obtained on standardized benchmarks where baselines have been tuned extensively by the research community."

    "abstract": "Abstract The Pathological Classification of Prostate Lesions in Genetically Engineered Mice (GEM) is the result of a directive from the National Cancer Institute Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium Prostate Steering Committee to provide a hierarchical taxonomy of disorders of the mouse prostate to facilitate classification of existing and newly created mouse models and the translation to human prostate pathology. The proposed Bar Harbor Classification system is the culmination of three meetings and workshops attended by various members of the Prostate Pathology Committee of the Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium. A 2-day Pathology Workshop was held at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, in October 2001, in which study sets of 93 slides from 22 GEM models were provided to individual panel members. The comparison of mouse and human prostate anatomy and disease demonstrates significant differences and considerable similarities that bear on the interpretation of the origin and natural history of their diseases. The recommended classification of mouse prostate pathology is hierarchical, and includes developmental, inflammatory, benign proliferative, and neoplastic disorders. Among the neoplastic disorders, preinvasive, microinvasive, and poorly differentiated neoplasms received the most attention. Specific criteria were recommended and will be discussed. Transitions between neoplastic states were of particular concern. Preinvasive neoplasias of the mouse prostate were recognized as focal, atypical, and progressive lesions. These lesions were designated as mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). Some atypical lesions were identified in mouse models without evidence of progression to malignancy. The panel recommended that mPIN lesions not be given histological grades, but that mPIN be further classified as to the absence or presence of documented associated progression to invasive carcinoma. Criteria for recognizing microinvasion, for classification of invasive gland-forming adenocarcinomas, and for characterizing poorly differentiated tumors, including neuroendocrine carcinomas, were developed and are discussed. The uniform application of defined terminology is essential for correlating results between different laboratories and models. It is recommended that investigators use the Bar Harbor Classification system when characterizing new GEM models or when conducting experimental interventions that may alter the phenotype or natural history of lesion progression in existing models."

    "abstract": "Graphs are fundamental data structures and have been employed for centuries to model real-world systems and phenomena. Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good proximity score between two nodes in a graph, and it has been successfully used in many applications such as automatic image captioning, recommender systems, and link prediction. The goal of this work is to find nodes that have top-k highest proximities for a given node. Previous approaches to this problem find nodes efficiently at the expense of exactness. The main motivation of this paper is to answer, in the affirmative, the question, 'Is it possible to improve the search time without sacrificing the exactness?'. Our solution, K-dash , is based on two ideas: (1) It computes the proximity of a selected node efficiently by sparse matrices, and (2) It skips unnecessary proximity computations when searching for the top-k nodes. Theoretical analyses show that K-dash guarantees result exactness. We perform comprehensive experiments to verify the efficiency of K-dash. The results show that K-dash can find top-k nodes significantly faster than the previous approaches while it guarantees exactness."

The rise of Internet of Things, Internet of Systems, and wireless body area networks has endowed the health care ecosystem with a new digital transformation supported by sophisticated machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Under this umbrella, health care recommendation systems have emerged as a driver for providing patient\u2010centric personalized health care services. Recommendation systems are automatic systems that derive the decisions on the basis of some valid input parameters and vital health information collected through wearable devices, implantable equipments, and various sensor. Therefore, to understand the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art developments in the health care ecosystem, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on health care recommendation systems and the associated paradigms.

This study also provides the systematic review of the health care systems, the types of health care systems, and the recommender systems. Moreover, a deep analysis of health care recommender systems and its types is also presented. Finally, the open issues and challenges associated with the adaption and implementation of human\u2010centric Healthcare 4.0 ecosystem are discussed. This is provided to find out the possible research questions and gaps so that the corresponding solutions could be developed in the near future."

Collaborative filtering recommends items to users based on their historical rating information. There are two approaches: memory-based, which usually provides inaccurate but explainable recommendations; and model-based, whose recommendations are more precise but hard to understand. Here we propose a Bayesian model that not only provides us with recommendations as good as matrix factorization models, but these predictions can also be explained. The model is based on both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches, which recommends items by using similar users' and items' information, respectively. Experiments carried out using four datasets present good results compared to several state-of-the-art baselines, achieving the best performance using the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) quality measure and also improving the prediction's accuracy in some datasets."

Less attention, however, has been paid to understanding what these strengths and failure modes are. Understanding what causes particular recommenders to fail will facilitate better selection of the component recommenders for future hybrid systems and a better understanding of how individual recommender personalities can be harnessed to improve the recommender user experience. We present an analysis of the predictions made by several well-known recommender algorithms on the MovieLens 10M data set, showing that for many cases in which one algorithm fails, there is another that will correctly predict the rating."

In this paper, we first describe the generation process of the biased and unbiased feedback in recommender systems via two respective causal diagrams, where the difference between them can be regarded as the source of bias. We then define this difference as a confounding bias, which can be regarded as a collection of some specific biases that have previously been studied. For the case with biased feedback alone, we derive the conditions that need to be satisfied to obtain a debiased representation from the causal diagrams. Based on information theory, we propose a novel method called debiased information bottleneck (DIB) to optimize these conditions and then find a tractable solution for it. In particular, the proposed method constrains the model to learn a biased embedding vector with independent biased and unbiased components in the training phase, and uses only the unbiased component in the test phase to deliver more accurate recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a real product dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and discuss its properties."

Such techniques recommend items to users employing similar users' preference data. People use recommender systems to cope with information overload. Although collaborative filtering systems are widely used by E-commerce sites, they fail to protect users' privacy. Since many users might decide to give false information because of privacy concerns, collecting high quality data from users is not an easy task. Collaborative filtering systems using these data might produce inaccurate recommendations. To reserve privacy in collaborative filtering recommender systems, this paper presented a collaborative filtering algorithm based on randomized perturbation techniques and secure multiparty computation. The randomized perturbation techniques are used in the course of user data collection and can generate recommendations with decent accuracy. Employing secure multiparty computation to protect the privacy of collaborative filtering by distributing the user profiles between multiple repositories and exchange only a subset of the profile data, which is useful for the recommendation. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm based on randomized perturbation techniques and secure multiparty computation not only protect the users\u2019 privacy, but also can keep the accuracy."

    "title": "Adaptive Implicit Friends Identification over Heterogeneous Network for Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "The explicitly observed social relations from online social platforms have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to mitigate the data sparsity issue. However, the direct usage of explicit social relations may lead to an inferior performance due to the unreliability (e.g., noises) of observed links. To this end, the discovery of reliable relations among users plays a central role in advancing social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adaptively identify implicit friends toward discovering more credible user relations. Particularly, implicit friends are those who share similar tastes but could be distant from each other on the network topology of social relations. Methodologically, to find the implicit friends for each user, we first model the whole system as a heterogeneous information network, and then capture the similarity of users through the meta-path based embedding representation learning. Finally, based on the intuition that social relations have varying degrees of impact on different users, our approach adaptively incorporates different numbers of similar users as implicit friends for each user to alleviate the adverse impact of unreliable social relations for a more effective recommendation. Experimental analysis on three real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method and explain why implicit friends are helpful in improving social recommendation."

    "title": "Deep Collaborative Filtering with Multi-Aspect Information in Heterogeneous Networks",
    "abstract": "Recently, recommender systems play a pivotal role in alleviating the problem of information overload. Latent factor models have been widely used for recommendation. Most existing latent factor models mainly utilize the interaction information between users and items, although some recently extended models utilize some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent factor for users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the characteristics of users and the properties of items from the aspect of purchase history. However, the characteristics of users and the properties of items may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and category-aspect of items. Moreover, the latent factor models usually use the shallow projection, which cannot capture the characteristics of users and items well. Deep neural network has shown tremendous potential to model the non-linearity relationship between users and items. It can be used to replace shallow projection to model the complex correlation between users and items. In this paper, we propose a Neural network based Aspect-level Collaborative Filtering model (NeuACF) to exploit different aspect latent factors. Through modelling the rich object properties and relations in recommender system as a heterogeneous information network, NeuACF first extracts different aspect-level similarity matrices of users and items, respectively, through different meta-paths, and then feeds an elaborately designed deep neural network with these matrices to learn aspect-level latent factors. Finally, the aspect-level latent factors are fused for the top-N recommendation. Moreover, to fuse information from different aspects more effectively, we further propose NeuACF++ to fuse aspect-level latent factors with self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three real world datasets show that NeuACF and NeuACF++ significantly outperform both existing latent factor models and recent neural network models."

    "abstract": "Blended learning models that combine face-to-face and online learning are of great importance in modern higher education. However, their development should be in line with the recent changes in e-learning that emphasize a student-centered approach and use tools available on the Web to support the learning process. This paper presents research on implementing a contemporary blended learning model within the e-course \u201cHypermedia Supported Education\u201d. The blended model developed combines a learning management system (LMS), a set of Web 2.0 tools and the E-Learning Activities Recommender System (ELARS) to enhance personalized online learning. As well as incorporating various technologies, the model combines a number of pedagogical approaches, focusing on collaborative and problem-based learning, to ensure the achievement of the course learning outcomes. The results of the comparative study show the effectiveness of the proposed model in that students who performed personalized collaborative e-learning activities achieved better course results. These findings encourage the further application of the model to other computer science courses."

    "abstract": "Abstract The awareness and familiarity of elderly people with the use of new technologies have increased considerably in the last few years, which consequently cause a higher willingness to the use of these technologies in their daily lives. This allows the elderly to benefit from technology through active and conscious participation in activities related to health, leisure and promotion of social relationships, fostering active ageing. Three large dimensions cover almost a major part of health care within the framework of early and intermediate stages of active ageing: physical exercise, healthy nutrition and cognitive stimulation. In this paper, we present a nutritional recommender system, Nutrition for Elder Care, intended to help elderly users to draw up their own healthy diet plans following the nutritional experts guidelines. The system has been developed with the intensive use of Semantic Web technologies pursuing knowledge sharing and reuse between different applications and agents and the discovering of implicit new knowledge."

    "title": "BARS",
    "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed the rapid development of personalized recommendation techniques. Despite the significant progress made in both research and practice of recommender systems, to date, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmarking standard in this field. Many of the existing studies perform model evaluations and comparisons in an ad-hoc manner, for example, by employing their own private data splits or using a different experimental setting. However, such conventions not only increase the difficulty in reproducing existing studies, but also lead to inconsistent experimental results among them. This largely limits the credibility and practical value of research results in this field. To tackle these issues, we present an initiative project aimed for open benchmarking for recommender systems. In contrast to some earlier attempts towards this goal, we take one further step by setting up a standardized benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research, which integrates all the details about datasets, source code, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed with comprehensiveness and sustainability in mind. It spans both matching and ranking tasks, and also allows anyone to easily follow and contribute. We believe that our benchmark could not only reduce the redundant efforts of researchers to re-implement or re-run existing baselines, but also drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems."

    "title": "A unifying and general account of fairness measurement in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Fairness is fundamental to all information access systems, including recommender systems. However, the landscape of fairness definition and measurement is quite scattered with many competing definitions that are partial and often incompatible. There is much work focusing on specific \u2013 and different \u2013 notions of fairness and there exist dozens of metrics of fairness in the literature, many of them redundant and most of them incompatible. In contrast, to our knowledge, there is no formal framework that covers all possible variants of fairness and allows developers to choose the most appropriate variant depending on the particular scenario. In this paper, we aim to define a general, flexible, and parameterizable framework that covers a whole range of fairness evaluation possibilities. Instead of modeling the metrics based on an abstract definition of fairness, the distinctive feature of this study compared to the current state of the art is that we start from the metrics applied in the literature to obtain a unified model by generalization. The framework is grounded on a general work hypothesis: interpreting the space of users and items as a probabilistic sample space, two fundamental measures in information theory (Kullback\u2013Leibler Divergence and Mutual Information) can capture the majority of possible scenarios for measuring fairness on recommender system outputs. In addition, earlier research on fairness in recommender systems could be viewed as single-sided, trying to optimize some form of equity across either user groups or provider/procurer groups, without considering the user/item space in conjunction, thereby overlooking/disregarding the interplay between user and item groups. Instead, our framework includes the notion of statistical independence between user and item groups. We finally validate our approach experimentally on both synthetic and real data according to a wide range of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and real-world data sets, showing that with our framework we can measure fairness in a general, uniform, and meaningful way."

Such restriction can severely inhibit the efficiency of cloning genomic DNAs. We have quantitatively evaluated a total of 39 E.coli strains for their tolerance to cytosine methylation in phage and plasmid cloning systems. Quantitative estimations of relative tolerance to methylation for these strains are presented, together with the evaluation of the most promising strains in practical recombinant cloning situations. Host strains are recommended for different recombinant cloning requirements. These data also provide a rational basis for future construction of 'ideal' hosts combining optimal methylation tolerance with additional advantageous mutations."

    "abstract": "With recommender systems, users receive items recommended on the basis of their profile. New users experience the cold start problem: as their profile is very poor, the system performs very poorly. In this paper, classical new user cold start techniques are improved by exploiting the cold user data, i.e. the user data that is readily available (e.g. age, occupation, location, etc.), in order to automatically associate the new user with a better first profile. Relying on the existing \u03b1-community spaces model, a rule-based induction process is used and a recommendation process based on the \"level of agreement\" principle is defined. The experiments show that the quality of recommendations compares to that obtained after a classical new user technique, while the new user effort is smaller as no initial ratings are asked."

Recommendations should also usually strive to satisfy a specific purpose. Within the Moviepilot mood track of the context-aware movie recommendation challenge, we propose a novel movie similarity measure that is specific to the movie property demanded by the challenge, i.e., movie mood. Our measure is further exploited by a joint matrix factorization model for recommendation. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in exploiting mood-specific movie similarity for the recommendation with respect to several evaluation metrics, demonstrating that it could outperform several state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, mood-specific movie similarity is demonstrated to be more beneficial than general mood-based movie similarity, for the purpose of mood-specific recommendation."

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can naturally integrate node information and topological structure, have been demonstrated to be powerful in learning on graph data. These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework GraphRec. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/wenqifan03/GraphRec-WWW19}"

The meeting was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and unrestricted educational grants from pharmaceutical companies.The study group used peer-reviewed published information to form its principal recommendations. Expert opinion was used where good evidence was lacking.The study group met for 3 d to discuss key issues. Breakout groups focused on genetic, cardiological, auxological, psychological, gynecological, and general medical concerns and drafted recommendations for presentation to the whole group. Draft reports were available for additional comment on the meeting web site. Synthesis of the section reports and final revisions were reviewed by e-mail and approved by whole-group consensus.We suggest that parents receiving a prenatal diagnosis of TS be advised of the broad phenotypic spectrum and the good quality of life observed in TS in recent years. We recommend that magnetic resonance angiography be used in addition to echocardiography to evaluate the cardiovascular system and suggest that patients with defined cardiovascular defects be cautioned in regard to pregnancy and certain types of exercise. We recommend that puberty should not be delayed to promote statural growth. We suggest a comprehensive educational evaluation in early childhood to identify potential attention-deficit or nonverbal learning disorders. We suggest that caregivers address the prospect of premature ovarian failure in an open and sensitive manner and emphasize the critical importance of estrogen treatment for feminization and for bone health during the adult years. All individuals with TS require continued monitoring of hearing and thyroid function throughout the lifespan. We suggest that adults with TS be monitored for aortic enlargement, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia."

    "title": "Biomass burning emissions estimated with a global fire assimilation system based on observed fire radiative power",
    "abstract": "Abstract. The Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.0) calculates biomass burning emissions by assimilating Fire Radiative Power (FRP) observations from the MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. It corrects for gaps in the observations, which are mostly due to cloud cover, and filters spurious FRP observations of volcanoes, gas flares and other industrial activity. The combustion rate is subsequently calculated with land cover-specific conversion factors. Emission factors for 40 gas-phase and aerosol trace species have been compiled from a literature survey. The corresponding daily emissions have been calculated on a global 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 grid from 2003 to the present. General consistency with the Global Fire Emission Database version 3.1 (GFED3.1) within its accuracy is achieved while maintaining the advantages of an FRP-based approach: GFASv1.0 makes use of the quantitative information on the combustion rate that is contained in the FRP observations, and it detects fires in real time at high spatial and temporal resolution. GFASv1.0 indicates omission errors in GFED3.1 due to undetected small fires. It also exhibits slightly longer fire seasons in South America and North Africa and a slightly shorter fire season in Southeast Asia. GFASv1.0 has already been used for atmospheric reactive gas simulations in an independent study, which found good agreement with atmospheric observations. We have performed simulations of the atmospheric aerosol distribution with and without the assimilation of MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD). They indicate that the emissions of particulate matter need to be boosted by a factor of 2\u20134 to reproduce the global distribution of organic matter and black carbon. This discrepancy is also evident in the comparison of previously published top-down and bottom-up estimates. For the time being, a global enhancement of the particulate matter emissions by 3.4 is recommended. Validation with independent AOD and PM10 observations recorded during the Russian fires in summer 2010 show that the global Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Change (MACC) aerosol model with GFASv1.0 aerosol emissions captures the smoke plume evolution well when organic matter and black carbon are enhanced by the recommended factor. In conjunction with the assimilation of MODIS AOD, the use of GFASv1.0 with enhanced emission factors quantitatively improves the forecast of the aerosol load near the surface sufficiently to allow air quality warnings with a lead time of up to four days."

Bayesian belief nets (BNs), one of the most frequently used classifiers, can be used for CF tasks. Previous works of applying BNs to CF tasks were mainly focused on binary-class data, and used simple or basic Bayesian classifiers (Miyahara and Pazzani, 2002; Breese et al., 1998). In this work, we apply advanced BNs models to CF tasks instead of simple ones, and work on real-world multi-class CF data instead of synthetic binary-class data. Empirical results show that with their ability to deal with incomplete data, extended logistic regression on naive Bayes and tree augmented naive Bayes (NB-ELR and TAN-ELR) models (Greiner et al., 2005) consistently perform better than the state-of-the-art Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm. In addition, the ELR-optimized BNs CF models are robust in terms of the ability to make predictions, while the robustness of the Pearson correlation-based CF algorithm degrades as the sparseness of the data increases"

Previous methods mainly focus on optimizing recommendation accuracy. However, they usually ignore the diversity of the recommendation results, thus usually results in unsatisfying user experiences. In this paper, we propose a novel diversified recommendation model, named Diversified Contextual Combinatorial Bandit (DC2B), for interactive recommendation with users' implicit feedback. Specifically, DC2B employs determinantal point process in the recommendation procedure to promote diversity of the recommendation results. To learn the model parameters, a Thompson sampling-type algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference is proposed. In addition, theoretical regret analysis is also provided to guarantee the performance of DC2B. Extensive experiments on real datasets are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in balancing the recommendation accuracy and diversity."

However, recommendations from traditional recommender system may not satisfy the new human beings because users may already know these relevant items from other information sources. We believe that there are still some unsearched but less relevant items useful for users. On the other hand, because social network has grown very quickly, we think that there are some very useful interactive information that recommender systems can use to provide recommendations. Therefore, we propose a Social Network-based Serendipity (SNS) recommender system that uses interactive information from the social network to find out which items are interesting for users but hard to discover by themselves."

A recommended procedure is to give patients appointments at regular intervals, each equal to the average consultation time; the consultant commencing work when the second patient arrives.

    "abstract": "Tagging systems have become major infrastructures on the Web. They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reflect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources in order to improve search. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics to which new resources with only a few tags are mapped. Based on this, other tags belonging to a topic can be recommended for the new resource. Our evaluation shows that the approach achieves significantly better precision and recall than the use of association rules, suggested in previous work, and also recommends more specific tags. Moreover, extending resources with these recommended tags significantly improves search for new resources."

This work presents a framework for automated selection of informative content-based features, that is independent of the type of recommender system or the type of features. We evaluate on recommenders from different domains: books, movies and smart-phone apps, and show effective results on each. In addition, we show how to use the proposed methods to generate meaningful features from text."

A good recommender system should be able to not only find out the objects preferred by users, but also help users in discovering their personalized tastes. The former corresponds to high accuracy of the recommendation, while the latter to high diversity. A big challenge is to design an algorithm that provides both highly accurate and diverse recommendation. Traditional recommendation algorithms only take into account the contributions of similar users, thus, they tend to recommend popular items for users ignoring the diversity of recommendations. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm by considering both the effects of similar and dissimilar users under the framework of collaborative filtering. Extensive analyses on three datasets, namely MovieLens, Netflix and Amazon, show that our method performs much better than the standard collaborative filtering algorithm for both accuracy and diversity."

In this context, there is a need for a system that can recommend top-k packages for the user to choose from.

The system leverages rating information from underlying recommender systems, allows flexible package configuration and incorporates users' cost budgets on both time and money. Furthermore, the proposed CompRec-Trip system has a rich graphical user interface which allows users to customize the returned composite recommendations and take into account external local information."

Among a variety of movie recommender systems, content-based methods always ring a bell when it comes to recommending new movies. Content-based method uses the content of the movie as input so that it does not suffer from the \"cold-start\" problem. In this paper, we propose the Fully Content-based Movie Recommender System (FCMR) to recommend movies to users. The proposed method trains a neural network model, Word2Vec CROW, with content information (e.g., cast, crew, etc.) as the training data to obtain vector form features of each element, and then take advantage of the linear relationship of learned feature to calculate the similarity between each movie. In the end, the proposed FCMR recommends movies based on the similarity. The experiments are conducted on a massive real world dataset, and the intuition behind our proposed method has been proven by the experiment results."

While many recent efforts show the effectiveness of neural network-based social recommender systems, several important challenges have not been well addressed yet: (i) The majority of models only consider users\u2019 social connections, while ignoring the inter-dependent knowledge across items; (ii) Most of existing solutions are designed for singular type of user-item interactions, making them infeasible to capture the interaction heterogeneity; (iii) The dynamic nature of user-item interactions has been less explored in many social-aware recommendation techniques. To tackle the above challenges, this work proposes a Knowledge-aware Coupled Graph Neural Network (KCGN) that jointly injects the inter-dependent knowledge across items and users into the recommendation framework. KCGN enables the high-order user- and item-wise relation encoding by exploiting the mutual information for global graph structure awareness. Additionally, we further augment KCGN with the capability of capturing dynamic multi-typed user-item interactive patterns. Experimental studies on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method against many strong baselines in a variety of settings.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been proposed to exploit the potential of social network by filtering the information and offer recommendations to a user that he is predicted to like. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is believed to be a suitable underlying technique for recommender systems on social network, because CF gathers tastes of similar users; and social network provides such a collaborative social environment. One inherent challenge however for running CF on social network is quantitative estimation of trust between friends. Although many researchers investigated trust metrics and models in social network, none so far has efficiently integrated them in a CF algorithm. The contribution of this paper is a framework of collaborative filtering on social network, and a novel approach in measuring trust factors by data-mining over a survey dataset provided by The Facebook Project. The quantitatively estimated trust factors can be used as input parameters in the CF algorithm. Facebook is taken as a case study here to illustrate the concepts."

Product reviews provide other user's experiences and, when consulted during a decision making process, tend to increase the user's confidence in the decision by providing a feeling of greater objectivity in the product description compared with commercial information. Notwithstanding their value, until now, product reviews have not been integrated in travel recommender systems, they have been used only in dedicated web sites. In this paper we present the results of a first step towards the introduction of product reviews in a travel recommender system, namely the outcome of a user behaviour survey. In this survey, we investigated the possible roles/functions of product reviews in the product selection decision process. In this paper we show that there is a significant difference in the role of reviews with respect to the product involved in the decision process (e.g. hotel vs. activity) and we demonstrate that advanced users, i.e., users who are familiar with online booking platforms and with consumer-opinion platforms, are more interested in consulting reviews that criticize the product and express a negative evaluation of it."

Randomized controlled trials and trials that objectively measured physicians' performance or health care outcomes were emphasized.Articles were reviewed to determine the effect of various factors on the adoption of guidelines.The articles showed that CPG dissemination or implementation processes have mixed results. Variables that affect the adoption of guidelines include qualities of the guidelines, characteristics of the health care professional, characteristics of the practice setting, incentives, regulation and patient factors. Specific strategies fell into 2 categories: primary strategies involving mailing or publication of the actual guidelines and secondary interventional strategies to reinforce the guidelines. The interventions were shown to be weak (didactic, traditional continuing medical education and mailings), moderately effective (audit and feedback, especially concurrent, targeted to specific providers and delivered by peers or opinion leaders) and relatively strong (reminder systems, academic detailing and multiple interventions).The evidence shows serious deficiencies in the adoption of CPGs in practice. Future implementation strategies must overcome this failure through an understanding of the forces and variables influencing practice and through the use of methods that are practice- and community-based rather than didactic."

Although Candidatus was devised as a provisional category to classify uncultured taxa, it has not been widely accepted owing to technical limitations and lack of priority of Candidatus names in the official nomenclature. High-throughput sequencing provides the potential for data-rich taxonomic descriptions of uncultivated microbes, comparable in quality to those of cultured organisms. In order to fully realize this potential, standards and guidelines on how to perform these descriptions are needed. Here we aimed to outline these standards and draw the roadmap for a new genome-based taxonomy that, at least initially, would be parallel but highly convergent to the one in existence for isolates. In particular, we recommend the use of DNA genome sequences, recovered by population binning or single-cell techniques, as the basis for (i) identification and phylogenetic placement, (ii) bioinformatics-based functional and thus phenotypic predictions, as well as (iii) type material. We also recommend the implementation of an independent nomenclatural system for uncultivated taxa, following the same nomenclature rules as those for cultured Bacteria and Archaea but with its own list of validly published names. If widely adopted, this system will not only facilitate a comprehensive characterization of the 'uncultivated majority', but also provide a unified catalogue of validly published names, thereby avoiding synonyms and confusion.

    "title": "Glutamine: Metabolism and Immune Function, Supplementation and Clinical Translation",
    "abstract": "Glutamine is the most abundant and versatile amino acid in the body. In health and disease, the rate of glutamine consumption by immune cells is similar or greater than glucose. For instance, in vitro and in vivo studies have determined that glutamine is an essential nutrient for lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, macrophage phagocytic plus secretory activities, and neutrophil bacterial killing. Glutamine release to the circulation and availability is mainly controlled by key metabolic organs, such as the gut, liver, and skeletal muscles. During catabolic/hypercatabolic situations glutamine can become essential for metabolic function, but its availability may be compromised due to the impairment of homeostasis in the inter-tissue metabolism of amino acids. For this reason, glutamine is currently part of clinical nutrition supplementation protocols and/or recommended for immune suppressed individuals. However, in a wide range of catabolic/hypercatabolic situations (e.g., ill/critically ill, post-trauma, sepsis, exhausted athletes), it is currently difficult to determine whether glutamine supplementation (oral/enteral or parenteral) should be recommended based on the amino acid plasma/bloodstream concentration (also known as glutaminemia). Although the beneficial immune-based effects of glutamine supplementation are already established, many questions and evidence for positive in vivo outcomes still remain to be presented. Therefore, this paper provides an integrated review of how glutamine metabolism in key organs is important to cells of the immune system. We also discuss glutamine metabolism and action, and important issues related to the effects of glutamine supplementation in catabolic situations."

    "title": "Dynamic User Modeling in Social Media Systems",
    "abstract": "Social media provides valuable resources to analyze user behaviors and capture user preferences. This article focuses on analyzing user behaviors in social media systems and designing a latent class statistical mixture model, named temporal context-aware mixture model (TCAM), to account for the intentions and preferences behind user behaviors. Based on the observation that the behaviors of a user in social media systems are generally influenced by intrinsic interest as well as the temporal context (e.g., the public's attention at that time), TCAM simultaneously models the topics related to users' intrinsic interests and the topics related to temporal context and then combines the influences from the two factors to model user behaviors in a unified way. Considering that users' interests are not always stable and may change over time, we extend TCAM to a dynamic temporal context-aware mixture model (DTCAM) to capture users' changing interests. To alleviate the problem of data sparsity, we exploit the social and temporal correlation information by integrating a social-temporal regularization framework into the DTCAM model. To further improve the performance of our proposed models (TCAM and DTCAM), an item-weighting scheme is proposed to enable them to favor items that better represent topics related to user interests and topics related to temporal context, respectively. Based on our proposed models, we design a temporal context-aware recommender system (TCARS). To speed up the process of producing the top- k recommendations from large-scale social media data, we develop an efficient query-processing technique to support TCARS. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our models on four real-world datasets crawled from different social media sites. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our models, compared with the state-of-the-art competitor methods, by modeling user behaviors more precisely and making more effective and efficient recommendations."

    "title": "Optimal Design for Social Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the design of a recommender system for organizing social learning on a product. To improve incentives for early experimentation, the optimal design trades off fully transparent social learning by over-recommending a product (or \u201cspamming\u201d) to a fraction of agents in the early phase of the product cycle. Under the optimal scheme, the designer spams very little about a product right after its release but gradually increases the frequency of spamming and stops it altogether when the product is deemed sufficiently unworthy of recommendation. The optimal recommender system involves randomly triggered spamming when recommendations are public - as is often the case for product ratings - and an information \u201cblackout\u201d followed by a burst of spamming when agents can choose when to check in for a recommendation. Fully transparent recommendations may become optimal if a (socially-benevolent) designer does not observe the agents\u2019 costs of experimentation."

    "title": "An effective social recommendation method based on user reputation model and rating profile enhancement",
    "abstract": "Trust-aware recommender systems are advanced approaches which have been developed based on social information to provide relevant suggestions to users. These systems can alleviate cold start and data sparsity problems in recommendation methods through trust relations. However, the lack of sufficient trust information can reduce the efficiency of these methods. Moreover, diversity and novelty are important measures for providing more attractive suggestions to users. In this article, a reputation-based approach is proposed to improve trust-aware recommender systems by enhancing rating profiles of the users who have insufficient ratings and trust information. In particular, we use a user reliability measure to determine the effectiveness of the rating profiles and trust networks of users in predicting unseen items. Then, a novel user reputation model is introduced based on the combination of the rating profiles and trust networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to enhance the rating profiles of the users who have low user reliability measure by adding a number of virtual ratings. To this end, the proposed user reputation model is used to predict the virtual ratings. In addition, the diversity, novelty and reliability measures of items are considered in the proposed rating profile enhancement mechanism. Therefore, the proposed method can improve the recommender systems about the cold start and data sparsity problems and also the diversity, novelty and reliability measures. Experimental results based on three real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher performance than other recommendation methods."

    "title": "Query-based Music Recommendations via Preference Embedding",
    "abstract": "A common scenario considered in recommender systems is to predict a user's preferences on unseen items based on his/her preferences on observed items. A major limitation of this scenario is that a user might be interested in different things each time when using the system, but there is no way to allow the user to actively alter or adjust the recommended results. To address this issue, we propose the idea of \"query-based recommendation\" that allows a user to specify his/her search intention while exploring new items, thereby incorporating the concept of information retrieval into recommendation systems. Moreover, the idea is more desirable when the user intention can be expressed in different ways. Take music recommendation as an example: the proposed system allows a user to explore new song tracks by specifying either a track, an album, or an artist. To enable such heterogeneous queries in a recommender system, we present a novel technique called \"Heterogeneous Preference Embedding\" to encode user preference and query intention into low-dimensional vector spaces. Then, with simple search methods or similarity calculations, we can use the encoded representation of queries to generate recommendations. This method is fairly flexible and it is easy to add other types of information when available. Evaluations on three music listening datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art matrix factorization and network embedding methods."

    "title": "Computing and applying trust in web-based social networks",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of web-based social networks has lead to new innovations in social networking, particularly by allowing users to describe their relationships beyond a basic connection. In this dissertation, I look specifically at trust in web-based social networks, how it can be computed, and how it can be used in applications. I begin with a definition of trust and a description of several properties that affect how it is used in algorithms. This is complemented by a survey of web-based social networks to gain an understanding of their scope, the types of relationship information available, and the current state of trust. \r\nThe computational problem of trust is to determine how much one person in the network should trust another person to whom they are not connected. I present two sets of algorithms for calculating these trust inferences: one for networks with binary trust ratings, and one for continuous ratings. For each rating scheme, the algorithms are built upon the defined notions of trust. Each is then analyzed theoretically and with respect to simulated and actual trust networks to determine how accurately they calculate the opinions of people in the system. I show that in both rating schemes the algorithms presented can be expected to be quite accurate. \r\nThese calculations are then put to use in two applications. FilmTrust is a website that combines trust, social networks, and movie ratings and reviews. Trust is used to personalize the website for each user, displaying recommended movie ratings, and ordering reviews by relevance. I show that, in the case where the user's opinion is divergent from the average, the trust-based recommended ratings are more accurate than several other common collaborative filtering techniques. The second application is TrustMail, an email client that uses the trust rating of each sender as a score for the message. Users can then sort messages according to their trust value. \r\nI conclude with a description of other applications where trust inferences can be used, and how the lessons from this dissertation can be applied to infer information about relationships in other complex systems."

    "abstract": "Trust has been extensively studied and its effectiveness demonstrated in recommender systems. Due to the lack of explicit trust information in most systems, many trust metric approaches have been proposed to infer implicit trust from user ratings. However, previous works have not compared these different approaches, and oftentimes focus only on the performance of predictive item ratings. In this paper, we first analyse five kinds of trust metrics in light of the properties of trust. We conduct an empirical study to explore the ability of trust metrics to distinguish explicit trust from implicit trust and to generate accurate predictions. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that existing trust metrics cannot provide satisfying performance, and indicate that future metrics should be designed more carefully."

However, learning people's food preferences and making recommendations that simultaneously appeal to their palate and satisfy nutritional expectations are challenging. Existing approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized nutrient-based meal recommender system designed to meet individuals' nutritional expectations, dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via a visual quiz-based user interface and projects the learned profile into the domain of nutritionally appropriate food options to find ones that will appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me and further describe and evaluate two innovative contributions. The first contriution is an open source state-of-the-art food image analysis model, named FoodDist. We demonstrate FoodDist's superior performance through careful benchmarking and discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. The second contribution is a novel online learning framework that learns food preference from itemwise and pairwise image comparisons. We evaluate the framework in a field study of 227 anonymous users and demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. We further conducted an end-to-end validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63%."

Group attacks are attacks that target a group of items instead of one, and there are common attributes among these items. Such profiles will have a good probability of being similar to a large number of user profiles, making them hard to detect. We propose a novel technique for identifying group attack profiles which uses an improved metric based on Degree of Similarity with Top Neighbors (DegSim) and Rating Deviation from Mean Agreement (RDMA). We also extend our work with a detailed analysis of target item rating patterns. Experiments show that the combined methods can improve detection rates in user-based recommender systems."

Previously, we did a user survey that showed some personality dimensions (such as conscientiousness which is one of personality factors according to the big-five factor model) have significant impact not only on users' diversity preference over items' individual attributes, but also on their overall diversity needs when all attributes are combined. Motivated by the findings, in the current work, we propose a strategy that explicitly embeds personality, as a moderating factor, to adjust the diversity degree within multiple recommendations. Moreover, we performed a user evaluation on the developed system. The experimental results demonstrate an effective solution to generate personality-based diversity in recommender systems."

    "title": "Graph-Based Recommendation on Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have emerged as an essential response to the rapidly growing digital information phenomenon in which users are finding it more and more difficult to locate the right information at the right time. Systems under Web2.0 allow users not only to give resources- ratings but also to assign tags to them. Tags play a significant role in Web 2.0. They can be used for navigation, browsing, recommendation and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, which is based on social networks. The social network is established among users and items, taking into account both the information of ratings and tags. We consider users' co-tagging behaviors and add the similarity relationship to the graph to enhance the performance. Our algorithm is based on the Random Walk with Restarts but provides a more natural and efficient way to represent social networks. Having considered the influence of tags, the transition matrix is denser and the recommendation is more accurate. By evaluating our new algorithm and comparing it to the baseline algorithm which is used in many real world recommender systems on a real life dataset, we make the conclusion that our method performs better than the baseline method."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems apply machine learning and data mining techniques for filtering unseen information and can predict whether a user would like a given resource. To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by identifying other users with similar taste and use their opinions for recommendation; whereas content-based recommender systems recommend items based on the content information of the items. Moreover, machine learning classifiers can be used for recommendation by training them on content information. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialization, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hy- brid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed unique generalized switching hybrid recommendation algorithms that combine machine learning classifiers with the collaborative filtering recommender systems. Experimental results on two different data sets, show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and provide better performance\u2014in terms of accuracy and coverage\u2014than other algorithms while at the same time eliminate some recorded problems with the recommender systems."

    "title": "Structured analysis and system specification",
    "abstract": "DeMarco's Analysis and System Specification is the final paper chosen for inclusion in this book of classic articles on the structured revolution. It is last of three on the subject of analysis, and, together with Ross/Schoman [Paper 22] and Teichroew/Hershey [Paper 23], provides a good idea of the direction that structured analysis will be taking in the next few years.\r\n\r\nAny competent systems analyst undoubtedly could produce a five-page essay on What's Wrong with Conventional Analysis. DeMarco, being an ex-analyst, does so with pithy remarks, describing conventional analysis as follows\r\n\r\nInstead of a meaningful interaction between analyst and user, there is often a period of fencing followed by the two parties' studiously ignoring each other... The cost-benefit study is performed backwards by deriving the development budget as a function of expected savings. (Expected savings were calculated by prorating cost reduction targets handed down from On High.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing refreshing prose, DeMarco's approach differs somewhat --- in terms of emphasis --- from that of Teichroew/Hershey and of Ross/Schoman. Unlike his colleagues, DeMarco stresses the importance of the maintainability of the specification. Take, for instance, the case of one system consisting of six million lines of COBOL and written over a period of ten years by employees no longer with the organization. Today, nobody knows what the system does.t Not only have the program listings and source code been lost --- a relatively minor disaster that we all have seen too often --- but the specifications are completely out of date. Moreover, the system has grown so large that neither the users nor the data processing people have the faintest idea of what the system is supposed to be doing, let alone how the mysterious job is being accomplished! The example is far from hypothetical, for this is the fate that all large systems eventually will suffer, unless steps are taken to keep the specifications both current and understandable across generations of users.\r\n\r\nThe approach that DeMarco suggests --- an approach generally known today as structured analysis --- is similar in form to that proposed by Ross and Schoman, and emphasizes a top-down, partitioned, graphic model of the system-to-be. However, in contrast to Ross and Schoman, DeMarco also stresses the important role of a data dictionary and the role of scaled-down specifications, or minispecs, to be written in a rigorous subset of the English language known as Structured English.\r\n\r\nDeMarco also explains carefully how the analyst proceeds lrom a physical description of the user's current system, through a logical description of that same system, and eventually into a logical description of the new system that the user wants. Interestingly, DeMarco uses top-down, partitioned dataflow diagrams to illustrate this part of the so-called Project Life Cycle --- thus confirming that such a graphic model can be used to portray virtually any system.\r\n\r\nAs in other short papers on the subject, the details necessary for carrying out DeMarco's approach are missing or are dealt with in a superficial manner. Fortunately, the details can be found: Listed at the end of the paper are references to three full-length books and one videotape training course, all dealing with the kind of analysis approach recommended by DeMarco."

In order to evaluate these algorithms, we crawled a set of weblogs and construct a weblog graph. We expect that these algorithms based on the link structure perform very well for weblogs, since the average degree of nodes in the weblog graph is large. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithms on this data set. In particular, the acceptable performance of our algorithms on this data set justifies the use of a link-based recommender system for social networks with large average degree."

    "title": "A Privacy-Preserving Distributed Contextual Federated Online Learning Framework with Big Data Support in Social Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, the booming demand of big data analytics and the constraints of computational ability and network bandwidth have made it difficult for a stand-alone agent/service provider to provide suitable information for every user from the large volume online data within the limited time. To handle this challenge, a recommender system (RS) can call in a group of agents to collaborate to learn users' preference and taste, which is known as a distributed recommender system (DRS). DRSs can improve the accuracy of a traditional RS by requesting agents to share information with each other. However, it is challenging for DRSs to make personalized recommendations for each user due to the large amount of candidates. In addition, information sharing among agents raises a privacy concern. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving DRS in this paper, and then model each service provider as a distributed online learner with context-awareness. Service providers collaborate to make personalized recommendations by learning users' preferences according to the user context and users' history behaviors. We adopt the federated learning framework to help train a high quality privacy- preserving centralized model over a large number of distributed agents which is probably unreliable with relatively slow network connections. To handle big data scenario, we build an item-cluster tree to deal with online and increasing datasets from top to the bottom. We further consider the structure of social network and present an efficient algorithm to avoid more performance loss adaptively. Theoretical proofs show that our proposed algorithm can achieve sublinear regret and differential privacy protection simultaneously for service providers and users. Numerical results confirm that our novel framework can handle increasing big datasets and strike a trade-off between privacy-preserving level and the prediction accuracy."

We investigate whether it is possible to identify items affected by these feedback loops. We state sufficient assumptions to deconvolve the feedback loops while keeping the inverse solution tractable. We furthermore develop a metric to unravel the recommender system's influence on the entire user-item rating matrix. We use this metric on synthetic and real-world datasets to (1) identify the extent to which the recommender system affects the final rating matrix, (2) rank frequently recommended items, and (3) distinguish whether a user's rated item was recommended or an intrinsic preference. Our results indicate that it is possible to recover the ratings matrix of intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the ratings matrix without any temporal information."

However, the incorporation of distrust in addition to trust for improved recommendations has not been analyzed fully because of the absence of publically available data sets containing gradual information about trust and distrust concepts. Our work in this paper is an attempt toward introducing recommendation strategies exploiting both the trust and the distrust in the RSs to further enhance their quality of recommendations through fuzzy computational models for trust and distrust. Since trust and distrust concepts are gradual phenomenon, therefore these can be represented more naturally by fuzzy logic using linguistic expressions. The contributions of this paper are three fold: First, we propose fuzzy computational models for both the trust and distrust concepts through similarity as well as knowledge factors based on linguistic expressions.

    "title": "Hybrid recommender system with temporal information",
    "abstract": "In the last few years, many recommender systems have been proposed but most of them suffer from scalability, sparsity and cold start issues. The existing recommender systems don't consider contextual information in term of user current device, location, company and time etc. In this paper, we proposed Hybrid Recommender System that accounts item attributes similarity, user rating similarity, user demographic similarity and the temporal information to do recommendation. The proposed algorithm will produce better results as it uses temporal information in computing and uses hybrid structure, model-based and memory-based system to improve system scalability and accuracy simultaneously. It uses the temporal information in the recommendation process to make recommendation for user at specific time."

    "title": "Context adaptation in interactive recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Contextual factors can greatly influence the utility of recommendations for users. In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users' interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user's ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user's most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user's preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user's preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system."

    "title": "Death to Kappa: birth of quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement for accuracy assessment",
    "abstract": "Abstract The family of Kappa indices of agreement claim to compare a map's observed classification accuracy relative to the expected accuracy of baseline maps that can have two types of randomness: (1) random distribution of the quantity of each category and (2) random spatial allocation of the categories. Use of the Kappa indices has become part of the culture in remote sensing and other fields. This article examines five different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties mathematically and illustrate their limitations graphically, with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and the often-ignored conversion from an observed sample matrix to the estimated population matrix. This article concludes that these Kappa indices are useless, misleading and/or flawed for the practical applications in remote sensing that we have seen. After more than a decade of working with these indices, we recommend that the profession abandon the use of Kappa indices for purposes of accuracy assessment and map comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. This article shows how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from peer-reviewed literature.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a recommender system that is becoming increasingly relevant for the industry due to the growth of the Internet, which has made it much more difficult to effectively extract useful information. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy of the different CF families and we discuss the most relevant Privacy Preserving Collaborative Filtering (PPCF) methods in the literature. To understand the inherent challenges of the PPCF, we also conduct an overview of the current tendencies and major drawbacks of this kind of recommender systems, and we propose several strategies to overcome the shortcomings."

First of all, from a data perspective, we consider three important topics related to data issues (ie sparsity, bias and distribution shift ), and develop five packages accordingly, including meta-learning, data augmentation, debiasing, fairness and cross-domain recommendation. Furthermore, from a model perspective, we develop two benchmarking packages for Transformer-based and graph neural network~(GNN)-based models, respectively. All the packages (consisting of 65 new models) are developed based on a popular recommendation framework RecBole, ensuring that both the implementation and interface are unified. For each package, we provide complete implementations from data loading, experimental setup, evaluation and algorithm implementation. This library provides a valuable resource to facilitate the up-to-date research in recommender systems. The project is released at the link: \\urlhttps://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole2.0."

    "title": "Interactive Recommender System via Knowledge Graph-enhanced Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Interactive recommender system (IRS) has drawn huge attention because of its flexible recommendation strategy and the consideration of optimal long-term user experiences. To deal with the dynamic user preference and optimize accumulative utilities, researchers have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) into IRS. However, RL methods share a common issue of sample efficiency, i.e., huge amount of interaction data is required to train an effective recommendation policy, which is caused by the sparse user responses and the large action space consisting of a large number of candidate items. Moreover, it is infeasible to collect much data with explorative policies in online environments, which will probably harm user experience. In this work, we investigate the potential of leveraging knowledge graph (KG) in dealing with these issues of RL methods for IRS, which provides rich side information for recommendation decision making. Instead of learning RL policies from scratch, we make use of the prior knowledge of the item correlation learned from KG to (i) guide the candidate selection for better candidate item retrieval, (ii) enrich the representation of items and user states, and (iii) propagate user preferences among the correlated items over KG to deal with the sparsity of user feedback. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach with significant improvements against state-of-the-arts."

    "title": "Effective Attack Models for Shilling Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Systems",
    "abstract": "Significant vulnerabilities have recently been identified in collaborative filtering recommender systems. These vulnerabilities mostly emanate from the open nature of such systems and their reliance on user-specified judgments for building profiles. Attackers who cannot be readily distinguished from ordinary users may introduce biased data in an attempt to force the system to \u201cadapt\u201d in a manner advantageous to them. A handful of simple attack models have, so far, been identified, and there appear to be significant differences in the susceptibility of different recommendation techniques to these attacks. In particular, item-based collaborative filtering has been found to offer some security advantages over user-based collaborative filtering. Our research in secure personalization is examining a range of more complex attack models and recommendation techniques, paying particular attention to the costs and benefits of mounting an attack. In this paper, we take a closer look at item-based collaborative filtering. In particular, we propose a new attack model that focuses on a subset of users with similar tastes and show that such an attack can be highly successful against an item-based algorithm."

    "title": "OpenRec",
    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for deeper understanding of users\u00bb preferences, recommender systems have gone beyond simple user-item filtering and are increasingly sophisticated, comprised of multiple components for analyzing and fusing diverse information. Unfortunately, existing frameworks do not adequately support extensibility and adaptability and consequently pose significant challenges to rapid, iterative, and systematic, experimentation. In this work, we propose OpenRec, an open and modular Python framework that supports extensible and adaptable research in recommender systems. Each recommender is modeled as a computational graph that consists of a structured ensemble of reusable modules connected through a set of well-defined interfaces. We present the architecture of OpenRec and demonstrate that OpenRec provides adaptability, modularity and reusability while maintaining training efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Our case study illustrates how OpenRec can support an efficient design process to prototype and benchmark alternative approaches with inter-changeable modules and enable development and evaluation of new algorithms."

    "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of the role of algorithmic recommendation in contemporary music streaming services, describing how they work, how they relate to other algorithmic applications, and problems that have emerged from their use. Against a dominant discourse that pits algorithms against humans, it argues that contemporary recommender systems are best understood as 'ensembles', comprising a variety of algorithmic and human parts working in conjunction with each other. This suggests new directions for research, focusing not on the intrinsic character of human or algorithmic mediation, but rather how this sociotechnical ensemble is composed and conducted. The issues raised by algorithmic music recommendation are not new but variations on past concerns including payola, the treatment of so-called world music and the power of cultural intermediaries."

    "title": "Multi-criteria service recommendation based on user criteria preferences",
    "abstract": "Research in recommender systems is now starting to recognise the importance of multiple selection criteria to improve the recommendation output. In this paper, we present a novel approach to multi-criteria recommendation, based on the idea of clustering users in \"preference lattices\" (partial orders) according to their criteria preferences. We assume that some selection criteria for an item (product or a service) will dominate the overall ranking, and that these dominant criteria will be different for different users. Following this assumption, we cluster users based on their criteria preferences, creating a \"preference lattice\". The recommendation output for a user is then based on ratings by other users from the same or close clusters. Having introduced the general approach of clustering, we proceed to formulate three alternative recommendation methods instantiating the approach: (a) using the aggregation function of the criteria, (b) using the overall item ratings, and (c) combining clustering with collaborative filtering. We then evaluate the accuracy of the three methods using a set of experiments on a service ranking dataset, and compare them with a conventional collaborative filtering approach extended to cover multiple criteria. The results indicate that our third method, which combines clustering and extended collaborative filtering, produces the highest accuracy."

    "title": "Movie genome: alleviating new item cold start in movie recommendation",
    "abstract": "As of today, most movie recommendation services base their recommendations on collaborative filtering (CF) and/or content-based filtering (CBF) models that use metadata (e.g., genre or cast). In most video-on-demand and streaming services, however, new movies and TV series are continuously added. CF models are unable to make predictions in such a scenario, since the newly added videos lack interactions\u2014a problem technically known as new item cold start (CS). Currently, the most common approach to this problem is to switch to a purely CBF method, usually by exploiting textual metadata. This approach is known to have lower accuracy than CF because it ignores useful collaborative information and relies on human-generated textual metadata, which are expensive to collect and often prone to errors. User-generated content, such as tags, can also be rare or absent in CS situations. In this paper, we introduce a new movie recommender system that addresses the new item problem in the movie domain by (i) integrating state-of-the-art audio and visual descriptors, which can be automatically extracted from video content and constitute what we call the movie genome; (ii) exploiting an effective data fusion method named canonical correlation analysis, which was successfully tested in our previous works Deldjoo et al. (in: International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies. Springer, Berlin, pp 34\u201345, 2016b; Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. ACM, 2018b), to better exploit complementary information between different modalities; (iii) proposing a two-step hybrid approach which trains a CF model on warm items (items with interactions) and leverages the learned model on the movie genome to recommend cold items (items without interactions). Experimental validation is carried out using a system-centric study on a large-scale, real-world movie recommendation dataset both in an absolute cold start and in a cold to warm transition; and a user-centric online experiment measuring different subjective aspects, such as satisfaction and diversity. Results show the benefits of this approach compared to existing approaches."

    "title": "Understanding the role of latent feature diversification on choice difficulty and satisfaction",
    "abstract": "People like variety and often prefer to choose from large item sets. However, large sets can cause a phenomenon called \"choice overload\": they are more difficult to choose from, and as a result decision makers are less satisfied with their choices. It has been argued that choice overload occurs because large sets contain more similar items. To overcome this effect, the present paper proposes that increasing the diversity of item sets might make them more attractive and satisfactory, without making them much more difficult to choose from. To this purpose, by using structural equation model methodology, we study diversification based on the latent features of a matrix factorization recommender model. Study 1 diversifies a set of recommended items while controlling for the overall quality of the set, and tests it in two online user experiments with a movie recommender system. Study 1a tests the effectiveness of the latent feature diversification, and shows that diversification increases the perceived diversity and attractiveness of the item set, while at the same time reducing the perceived difficulty of choosing from the set. Study 1b subsequently shows that diversification can increase users' satisfaction with the chosen option, especially when they are choosing from small, diverse item sets. Study 2 extends these results by testing our diversification algorithm against traditional Top-N recommendations, and finds that diverse, small item sets are just as satisfying and less effortful to choose from than Top-N recommendations. Our results suggest that, at least for the movie domain, diverse small sets may be the best thing one could offer a user of a recommender system."

    "title": "Exploiting Cross-session Information for Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based recommender system introduces the concept of the session , i.e., a sequence of interactions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the user\u2019s recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender system mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions, which are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency relationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session information due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between different sessions is prevented. In this article, we solve these problems with the graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a graph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel F ull G raph N eural N etwork (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency. To exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual session\u2019s representation learning, we further construct a B roadly C onnected S ession (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout function to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e., Yoochoose and Diginetica , and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art session-based recommender models."

In this paper, we propose a principled approach to identify representative users and items using representative-based matrix factorization. Not only do we show that the selected representatives are superior to other competing methods in terms of achieving good balance between coverage and diversity, but we also demonstrate that ratings on the selected representatives are much more useful for making recommendations (about 10% better than competing methods). In addition to illustrating how representatives help solve the cold start problem, we also argue that the problem of finding representatives itself is an important problem that would deserve further investigations, for both its practical values and technical challenges."

Furthermore, results of an online experiment on a real-world platform show that users' perception of the usability of a recommender system is positively influenced by knowledgeable explanations and that consequently users' experience in interacting with the system, their intention to use it repeatedly as well as their commitment to recommend it to others are increased."

    "title": "Dual Channel Hypergraph Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most popular and important recommendation methodologies in the heart of numerous recommender systems today. Although widely adopted, existing CF-based methods, ranging from matrix factorization to the emerging graph-based methods, suffer inferior performance especially when the data for training are very limited. In this paper, we first pinpoint the root causes of such deficiency and observe two main disadvantages that stem from the inherent designs of existing CF-based methods, i.e., 1) inflexible modeling of users and items and 2) insufficient modeling of high-order correlations among the subjects. Under such circumstances, we propose a dual channel hypergraph collaborative filtering (DHCF) framework to tackle the above issues. First, a dual channel learning strategy, which holistically leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy, is introduced to learn the representation of users and items so that these two types of data can be elegantly interconnected while still maintaining their specific properties. Second, the hypergraph structure is employed for modeling users and items with explicit hybrid high-order correlations. The jump hypergraph convolution (JHConv) method is proposed to support the explicit and efficient embedding propagation of high-order correlations. Comprehensive experiments on two public benchmarks and two new real-world datasets demonstrate that DHCF can achieve significant and consistent improvements against other state-of-the-art methods."

In this work, we evaluate six recommendation algorithms from a user-centric perspective, collecting both objective user activity data and subjective user perceptions. In a field experiment involving 1508 users who participated for at least a month, we compare six algorithms built using machine learning techniques, ranging from supervised matrix factorization, contextual bandit learning to Q learning. We found that the objective design in machine-learning-based recommender systems significantly affects user experience. Specifically, a recommender optimizing for implicit action prediction error engages users more than optimizing for explicit rating prediction error when modeled with the classical matrix factorization algorithms, which empirically explains the historical transition of recommender system research from modeling explicit feedback data to implicit feedback data. However, the action-based recommender is not as precise as the rating-based recommender in that it increases not only positive engagement but also negative engagement, e.g., negative action rate and user browsing effort which are negatively correlated with user satisfaction. We show that blending both explicit and implicit feedback from users through an online learning algorithm can gain the benefits of engagement and mitigate one of the possible costs (i.e., the increased browsing effort)."

    "title": "Development of a New Patient-Reported Outcome Measure for Breast Surgery: The BREAST-Q",
    "abstract": "Measuring patient-reported outcomes has become increasingly important in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery. The objective of this study was to develop a new patient-reported outcome measure to assess the unique outcomes of breast surgery patients.Patient interviews, focus groups, expert panels, and a literature review were used to develop a conceptual framework and a list of questionnaire items. Three procedure-specific questionnaires (augmentation, reduction, and reconstruction) were developed and cognitive debriefing interviews used to pilot each questionnaire. Revised questionnaires were field tested with 1950 women at five centers in the United States and Canada (response rate, 72 percent); 491 patients also completed a test-retest questionnaire. Rasch measurement methods were used to construct scales, and traditional psychometric analyses, following currently recommended procedures and criteria, were performed to allow for comparison with existing measures.The conceptual framework included six domains: satisfaction with breasts, overall outcome, and process of care, and psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being. Independent scales were constructed for these domains. This new patient-reported outcome measure \"system\" (the BREAST-Q) contains three modules (augmentation, reconstruction, and reduction), each with a preoperative and postoperative version. Each scale fulfilled Rasch and traditional psychometric criteria (including person separation index 0.76 to 0.95; Cronbach's alpha 0.81 to 0.96; and test-retest reproducibility 0.73 to 0.96).The BREAST-Q can be used to study the impact and effectiveness of breast surgery from the patient's perspective. By quantifying satisfaction and important aspects of health-related quality of life, the BREAST-Q has the potential to support advocacy, quality metrics, and an evidence-based approach to surgical practice."

    "title": "Foresight",
    "abstract": "Current tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA) require users to manually select data attributes, statistical computations and visual encodings. This can be daunting for large-scale, complex data. We introduce Foresight, a system that helps the user rapidly discover visual insights from large high-dimensional datasets. Formally, an \"insight\" is a strong manifestation of a statistical property of the data, e.g., high correlation between two attributes, high skewness or concentration about the mean of a single attribute, a strong clustering of values, and so on. For each insight type, Foresight initially presents visualizations of the top k instances in the data, based on an appropriate ranking metric. The user can then look at \"nearby\" insights by issuing \"insight queries\" containing constraints on insight strengths and data attributes. Thus the user can directly explore the space of insights, rather than the space of data dimensions and visual encodings as in other visual recommender systems. Foresight also provides \"global\" views of insight space to help orient the user and ensure a thorough exploration process. Furthermore, Foresight facilitates interactive exploration of large datasets through fast, approximate sketching."

    "title": "Learning Distributed Representations from Reviews for Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that collaborative filter-based recommender systems can be improved by incorporating side information, such as natural language reviews, as a way of regularizing the derived product representations. Motivated by the success of this approach, we introduce two different models of reviews and study their effect on collaborative filtering performance. While the previous state-of-the-art approach is based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of reviews, the models we explore are neural network based: a bag-of-words product-of-experts model and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the increased flexibility offered by the product-of-experts model allowed it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon review dataset, outperforming the LDA-based approach. However, interestingly, the greater modeling power offered by the recurrent neural network appears to undermine the model's ability to act as a regularizer of the product representations."

    "abstract": "Cephalalgia has been successful by a number of measures in the last 12 months: our circulation is up particularly through electronic penetration in libraries, our submission rate has risen substantially and our impact factor remains high amongst clinical neuroscience journals. We are entering our fifth and last year of the current publisher\u2019s contract. In the life of the contract we have switched to a very successful on-line submission system, finalized details for a new CDROM containing all issues of Cephalalgia and Headache, and will publish this year the revised International Headache Society classification for headache (1). All of this is excellent progress The journal continues to attract a range of important, interesting and often very thought-provoking submissions. We have benefitted greatly from the broad range of interests of the Associate Editors we are able to recommend and solicit high-quality expert reviews that keep the scientific standards high. In keeping with our general philosophy there is a need for renewal amongst the Associate Editors, and Professor Peer Tfelt-Hansen will be standing down. Peer is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative figures on clinical trial methodology in headache, his wide contributions to the field have appropriately lead to his election as President of the International Headache Society. The journal thanks him for his contributions, and congratulates him on his election. After wide consultation I have invited Professor Nahib Ramadan, University of Chicago, to join the Associate Editors. Professor Ramadan was extensively involved in the journal under the previous Editor-in-Chief, Professor K. Michael Welch, and brings both excellence in academic life and a stint in industry with that important perspective to the Board. I welcome his acceptance of the invitation. From this issue Cephalalgia will become a monthly journal. We have a strong throughput of excellent work and rather than raise the rejection rate, and somewhat arbitrarily dismiss work that readers might be very interested in seeing, we felt it timely to increase to 12 issues a year. We hope this will allow more rapid publication of your accepted work and a greater range of interesting papers for readers in any one year. Let me close by thanking the Editorial Assistant Faye Cheeseman for her sterling efforts at the Blackwell\u2019s Office in keeping the journal ticking over, our referees whose expertise is the key to our success, the Associate Editors who do so much for the journal, and you the reader for your continued support for Cephalalgia."

    "title": "A Machine Learning-Based Recommender System for Improving Students Learning Experiences",
    "abstract": "Outcome-based education (OBE) is a well-proven teaching strategy based upon a predefined set of expected outcomes. The components of OBE are Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), Program Outcomes (POs), and Course Outcomes (COs). These latter are assessed at the end of each course and several recommended actions can be proposed by faculty members' to enhance the quality of courses and therefore the overall educational program. Considering a large number of courses and the faculty members' devotion, bad actions could be recommended and therefore undesirable and inappropriate decisions may occur. In this paper, a recommender system, using different machine learning algorithms, is proposed for predicting suitable actions based on course specifications, academic records, and course learning outcomes' assessments. We formulated the problem as a multi-label multi-class binary classification problem and the dataset was translated into different problem transformation and adaptive methods such as one-vs.-all, binary relevance, label powerset, classifier chain, and ML-KNN adaptive classifier. As a case study, the proposed recommender system is applied to the college of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for helping academic staff improving the quality of teaching strategies. The obtained results showed that the proposed recommender system presents more recommended actions for improving students' learning experiences."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems help users by recommending items, such as products and services, that can be of interest to these users. Context-aware recommender systems have been widely investigated in both academia and industry because they can make recommendations based on a user\u2019s current context (e.g., location and time). Moreover, the advent of Web 2.0 and the growing popularity of social and e-commerce media sites have encouraged users to naturally write texts describing their assessment of items. There are increasing efforts to incorporate the rich information embedded in user\u2019s reviews/texts into the recommender systems. Given the importance of this type of texts and their usage along with opinion mining and contextual information extraction techniques for recommender systems, we present a systematic review on the recommender systems that explore both contextual information and opinion mining. This systematic review followed a well-defined protocol. Its results were based on 17 papers, selected among 195 papers identified in four digital libraries. The results of this review give a general summary of the current research on this subject and point out some areas that may be improved in future primary works."

    "abstract": "Recommender system (RS) is a unique type of information clarification system that anticipates the user's evaluation of items from a large pool based on the expectations of a single stakeholder. The proposed system is highly useful for getting expected meaning suggestions and guidance for choosing the proper product using artificial intelligence and IoT (Internet of Things) such as chatbot. The current proposed technique makes it easier for stakeholders to make context-based decisions that are optimal rather than reactive, such as which product to buy, news classification based on high filtering views, highly recommended wanted music to choose, and desired product to choose. Recommendation systems are a critical tool for obtaining verified information and making accurate decisions. As a result, operational efficiency would skyrocket, and the risk to the company that uses a recommender system would plummet. This proposed solution can be used in a variety of applications such as commercial hotels OYO and other hotels, hospitals (GYAN), public administrative applications banks HDFC, and ICICI to address potential questions on the spot using intelligence computing as a recommendation system. The existing RS is considering a few factors such as buying records, classification or clustering items, and user's geographic location. Collaborative filtering algorithms (CFAs) are much more common approaches for cooperating to mesh the respective documents they retrieved from the historical data. CFAs are distinguished in plenty of features that are uncommon from other algorithms. In this existing system classification, precision and efficiency and error rate are statistical measurements that need to be enhanced according to the current need to fit for global requirements. The proposed work deals with enhancing accuracy levels of text reviews with the recommender system while interacting by the numerous users for their domains. The authors implemented the recommender system using a user-based CF method and presented the significance of collaborative filtering on the movie domain with a recommender system. This whole experiment has been implanted using the RapidMiner Java-based tool. Results have been compared with existing algorithms to differentiate the efficiency of the current proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Much of the recent progress in sequential and session-based recommendation has been driven by improvements in model architecture and pretraining techniques originating in the field of Natural Language Processing. Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation. But with a thousandfold more research going on in NLP, the application of transformers for recommendation understandably lags behind. To remedy this we introduce Transformers4Rec, an open-source library built upon HuggingFace\u2019s Transformers library with a similar goal of opening up the advances of NLP based Transformers to the recommender system community and making these advancements immediately accessible for the tasks of sequential and session-based recommendation. Like its core dependency, Transformers4Rec is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments."

The enormous volume of information can be devastating especially to mobile users exceeding human ability to differentiate information which is relevant and that which is irrelevant. For many yzears now, recommender system have become well-known, and have been studied in various domains such as e-learning, online shopping, tourism to help overcome information overload. Recommendations are produced based on users who have interests in a particular thing or item. This recommendation process was further enhanced by incorporating context such as time, weather, and location to make recommendations more accurate and efficient. However, these systems have introduced context-aware recommender systems. This paper presents a survey of Context-aware recommender systems, the background and algorithms of Context-aware Recommender System, and also discusses the open issues of context-aware recommender systems."

    "abstract": "More and more people are earing about the health and medical diagnosis problems. However, according to the administration's report, more than 200 thousand people in China, even 100 thousand in USA, die each year due to medication errors. More than 42% medication errors are caused by doctors because experts write the prescription according to their experiences which are quite limited. Technologies as data mining and recommender technologies provide possibilities to explore potential knowledge from diagnosis history records and help doctors to prescribe medication correctly to decrease medication error effectively. In this paper, we design and implement a universal medicine recommender system framework that applies data mining technologies to the recommendation system. The medicine recommender system consists of database system module, data preparation module, recommendation model module, model evaluation, and data visualization module. We investigate the medicine recommendation algorithms of the SVM (Support Vector Machine), BP neural network algorithm and ID3 decision tree algorithm based on the diagnosis data. Experiments are done to tune the parameters for each algorithm to get better performance. Finally, in the given open dataset, SVM recommendation model is selected for the medicine recommendation module to obtain a good trade-off among model accuracy, model efficiency, and model scalability. We also propose a mistake-check mechanism to ensure the diagnosis accuracy and service quality. Experimental results show our system can give medication recommendation with an excellent efficiency, accuracy and scalability."

    "abstract": "Non-negative latent factor (NLF) models well represent high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices filled with non-negative data, which are frequently encountered in industrial applications like recommender systems. However, current NLF models mostly adopt Euclidean distance in their objective function, which represents a special case of a \u03b2-divergence function. Hence, it is highly desired to design a \u03b2-divergence-based NLF ( \u03b2-NLF) model that uses a \u03b2-divergence function, and investigate its performance in recommender systems as \u03b2 varies. To do so, we first model \u03b2-NLF's learning objective with a \u03b2-divergence function. Subsequently, we deduce a general single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and multiplicative update scheme for \u03b2-NLF, and then design an efficient \u03b2-NLF algorithm. The experimental results on HiDS matrices from industrial applications indicate that by carefully choosing the value of \u03b2, \u03b2-NLF outperforms an NLF model with Euclidean distance in terms of accuracy for missing data prediction without increasing computational time. The research outcomes show the necessity of using an optimal \u03b2-divergence function in order to achieve the best performance of an NLF model on HiDS matrices. Hence, the proposed model has both theoretical and application significance."

Examples of such objectives include user behavioral metrics (e.g. clicks, streams, dwell time, etc), supplier exposure objectives (e.g. diversity) and platform centric objectives (e.g. promotions). Jointly optimizing multiple metrics in online recommender systems remains a challenging task.

    "title": "Social Attentional Memory Network",
    "abstract": "Social connections are known to be helpful for modeling users' potential preferences and improving the performance of recommender systems. However, in social-aware recommendations, there are two issues which influence the inference of users' preferences, and haven't been well-studied in most existing methods: First, the preferences of a user may only partially match that of his friends in certain aspects, especially when considering a user with diverse interests. Second, for an individual, the influence strength of his friends might be different, as not all friends are equally helpful for modeling his preferences in the system. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Social Attentional Memory Network (SAMN) for social-aware recommendation. Specifically, we first design an attention-based memory module to learn user-friend relation vectors, which can capture the varying aspect attentions that a user share with his different friends. Then we build a friend-level attention component to adaptively select informative friends for user modeling. The two components are fused together to mutually enhance each other and lead to a finer extended model. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed SAMN model consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Furthermore, qualitative studies have been made to explore what the proposed attention-based memory module and friend-level attention have learnt, which provide insights into the model's learning process."

    "abstract": "International experts met to discuss recent advances and to revise the 2004 recommendations for assessing and reporting precursor lesions to invasive carcinomas of the pancreas, including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), mucinous cystic neoplasm, and other lesions. Consensus recommendations include the following: (1) To improve concordance and to align with practical consequences, a 2-tiered system (low vs. high grade) is proposed for all precursor lesions, with the provision that the current PanIN-2 and neoplasms with intermediate-grade dysplasia now be categorized as low grade. Thus, \u201chigh-grade dysplasia\u201d is to be reserved for only the uppermost end of the spectrum (\u201ccarcinoma in situ\u201d\u2013type lesions). (2) Current data indicate that PanIN of any grade at a margin of a resected pancreas with invasive carcinoma does not have prognostic implications; the clinical significance of dysplasia at a margin in a resected pancreas with IPMN lacking invasive carcinoma remains to be determined. (3) Intraductal lesions 0.5 to 1 cm can be either large PanINs or small IPMNs. The term \u201cincipient IPMN\u201d should be reserved for lesions in this size with intestinal or oncocytic papillae or GNAS mutations. (4) Measurement of the distance between an IPMN and invasive carcinoma and sampling of intervening tissue are recommended to assess concomitant versus associated status. Conceptually, concomitant invasive carcinoma (in contrast with the \u201cassociated\u201d group) ought to be genetically distinct from an IPMN elsewhere in the gland. (5) \u201cIntraductal spread of invasive carcinoma\u201d (aka, \u201ccolonization\u201d) is recommended to describe lesions of invasive carcinoma invading back into and extending along the ductal system, which may morphologically mimic high-grade PanIN or even IPMN. (6) \u201cSimple mucinous cyst\u201d is recommended to describe cysts >1 cm having gastric-type flat mucinous lining at most minimal atypia without ovarian-type stroma to distinguish them from IPMN. (7) Human lesions resembling the acinar to ductal metaplasia and atypical flat lesions of genetically engineered mouse models exist and may reflect an alternate pathway of carcinogenesis; however, their biological significance requires further study. These revised recommendations are expected to improve our management and understanding of precursor lesions in the pancreas."

    "abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to propose a new efficient semantic recommender method for Arabic content. Design/methodology/approach Three semantic similarities were proposed to be integrated with the recommender system to improve its ability to recommend based on the semantic aspect. The proposed similarities are CHI-based semantic similarity, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based semantic similarity and Arabic WordNet-based semantic similarity. These similarities were compared with the existing similarities used by recommender systems from the literature. Findings Experiments show that the proposed semantic method using CHI-based similarity and using SVD-based similarity are more efficient than the existing methods on Arabic text in term of accuracy and execution time. Originality/value Although many previous works proposed recommender system methods for English text, very few works concentrated on Arabic Text. The field of Arabic Recommender Systems is largely understudied in the literature. Aside from this, there is a vital need to consider the semantic relationships behind user preferences to improve the accuracy of the recommendations. The contributions of this work are the following. First, as many recommender methods were proposed for English text and have never been tested on Arabic text, this work compares the performance of these widely used methods on Arabic text. Second, it proposes a novel semantic recommender method for Arabic text. As this method uses semantic similarity, three novel base semantic similarities were proposed and evaluated. Third, this work would direct the attention to more studies in this understudied topic in the literature."

Our method uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to generate personal item authorities for each user and combines them with item proximities for better ranking. To demonstrate our approach, we build a prototype movie search and browsing engine called MAD6 (Movies, Actors and Directors; 6 degrees of separation). We conduct offline and online tests of our ranking algorithm. For offline testing, we use Yahoo! Search queries that resulted in a click on a Yahoo! Movies or Internet Movie Database (IMDB) movie URL. Our online test involved 44 Yahoo! employees providing subjective assessments of results quality. In both tests, our ranking methods show significantly better recall and quality than IMDB search and Yahoo! Movies current search."

    "abstract": "Objectives: Today the recommendation technology has managed to achieve a distinct place in the modern and fascinating world of e-commerce applications as it helps the user in selecting items or products of his interest from a large pool. The present article aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the state-of-the-art recommender systems. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The entire literature review process was divided into six research questions keeping in view the different perspectives of recommendation field. The methodology adopted here, consists of the search plan and the paper selection criteria. The search plan attempts to retrieve the research studies through several digital libraries and the paper selection criteria help filter out the most relevant studies further to gather evidence against each of the research questions. Findings: The literature review process provides a thorough discussion on different techniques deployed in recommender system literature such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, social filtering, demographic and knowledge-based and utility based systems. It also explores their strengths and weaknesses. The recommender systems face certain challenges in their deployment such as cold-start, sparsity, scalability, user privacy, etc. The different application domains where recommender systems are being adopted these days include movie, music, books, news, tourism etc. The gap analysis conducted during literature review, focuses on improving the traditional recommendation approaches, the precise blend of existing approaches with different types of information, modeling of user profiles and recommended items, standardization of non-standard evaluation techniques etc. Application/Improvements: This paper also throws some light on certain application fields such as television, research grants, restaurant, job search, etc. that need to grab the attention of scientific and research communities to promote more research in those areas.

    "title": "Recommending user generated item lists",
    "abstract": "Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items which users may be interested in. User-generated item lists on the other hand have become a popular feature in many applications. E.g., Goodreads provides users with an interface for creating and sharing interesting book lists. These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed. Unfortunately, existing recommender systems are not designed for recommending user-generated item lists. In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called LIRE for recommending them. The proposed model takes into consideration users' previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in LIRE a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern. Through extensive experiments on a real item list dataset from Goodreads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LIRE model."

    "title": "Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Outcome Reports: Update of the Utstein Resuscitation Registry Templates for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest",
    "abstract": "Utstein-style guidelines contribute to improved public health internationally by providing a structured framework with which to compare emergency medical services systems. Advances in resuscitation science, new insights into important predictors of outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and lessons learned from methodological research prompted this review and update of the 2004 Utstein guidelines. Representatives of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation developed an updated Utstein reporting framework iteratively by meeting face to face, by teleconference, and by Web survey during 2012 through 2014. Herein are recommendations for reporting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Data elements were grouped by system factors, dispatch/recognition, patient variables, resuscitation/postresuscitation processes, and outcomes. Elements were classified as core or supplemental using a modified Delphi process primarily based on respondents' assessment of the evidence-based importance of capturing those elements, tempered by the challenges to collect them. New or modified elements reflected consensus on the need to account for emergency medical services system factors, increasing availability of automated external defibrillators, data collection processes, epidemiology trends, increasing use of dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emerging field treatments, postresuscitation care, prognostication tools, and trends in organ recovery. A standard reporting template is recommended to promote standardized reporting. This template facilitates reporting of the bystander-witnessed, shockable rhythm as a measure of emergency medical services system efficacy and all emergency medical services system-treated arrests as a measure of system effectiveness. Several additional important subgroups are identified that enable an estimate of the specific contribution of rhythm and bystander actions that are key determinants of outcome."

    "title": "On-Device Next-Item Recommendation with Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Session-based recommender systems (SBR) are becoming increasingly popular because they can predict user interests without relying on long-term user profile and support login-free recommendation. Modern recommender systems operate in a fully server-based fashion. To cater to millions of users, the frequent model maintaining and the high-speed processing for concurrent user requests are required, which comes at the cost of a huge carbon footprint. Meanwhile, users need to upload their behavior data even including the immediate environmental context to the server, raising the public concern about privacy. On-device recommender systems circumvent these two issues with cost-conscious settings and local inference. However, due to the limited memory and computing resources, on-device recommender systems are confronted with two fundamental challenges: (1) how to reduce the size of regular models to fit edge devices? (2) how to retain the original capacity?"

    "abstract": "Repeat consumption is a common scenario in daily life, such as repurchasing items and revisiting websites, and is a critical factor to be taken into consideration for recommender systems. Temporal dynamics play important roles in modeling repeat consumption. It is noteworthy that for items with distinct lifetimes, consuming tendency for the next one fluctuates differently with time. For example, users may repurchase milk weekly, but it is possible to repurchase mobile phone after a long period of time. Therefore, how to adaptively incorporate various temporal patterns of repeat consumption into a holistic recommendation model has been a new and important problem."

    "abstract": "The fast growth of online communities and increasing popularity of internet-accessing smart devices have significantly changed the way people consume and share music. As an emerging technology to facilitate effective music retrieval on the move, intelligent recommendation has been recently received great attentions in recent years. While a large amount of efforts have been invested in the field, the technology is still in its infancy. One of the major reasons for this stagnation is due to inability of the existing approaches to comprehensively take multiple kinds of contextual information into account. In the paper, we present a novel recommender system called Just-for-Me to facilitate effective social music recommendation by considering users' location related contexts as well as global music popularity trends. We also develop an unified recommendation model to integrate the contextual factors as well as music contents simultaneously. Furthermore, pseudo-observations are proposed to overcome the cold-start and sparsity problems. An extensive experimental study based on different test collections demonstrates that Just-for-Me system can significantly improve the recommendation performance at various geo-locations."

    "abstract": "Objective: To provide an update to the \u201cSurviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,\u201d last published in 2008. Design: A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. Methods: The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations. Results: Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure \u2265 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7\u20139 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of \u2264 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose \u2264 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven \u201cabsolute\u201d\u2018 adrenal insufficiency (2C). Conclusions: Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients."

A recommender system is an intelligent system can help users to come across interesting items. It uses data mining and information filtering techniques. The collaborative filtering creates suggestions for users based on their neighbors' preferences. But it suffers from its poor accuracy and scalability. This paper considers the users are m (m is the number of users) points in n dimensional space (n is the number of items) and represents an approach based on user clustering to produce a recommendation for active user by a new method. It uses k-means clustering algorithm to categorize users based on their interests. Then it uses a new method called voting algorithm to develop a recommendation. We evaluate the traditional collaborative filtering and the new one to compare them. Our results show the proposed algorithm is more accurate than the traditional one, besides it is less time consuming than it."

    "abstract": "With the expansion of e-commerce, recommender systems are drawing more and more attentions. Collaborative Filtering(CF) is the most popular algorithm used for recommendation, but it performs not very well for sparse data and new users. The emergence of trust-based recommender system has solved the problem of CF in a better way. A system of this kind is commonly constructed based upon social network with trust relations. It contains not only user-item rating relations, but also friendships between users, and the friendships are very meaningful in recommendation. However, the trust values in the networks are all specified by users, which are subjective processes. In this paper, we propose a Top-K recommender system on social tagging network, and design a user-item rating matrix construction method on user browsed or searched information. We use tags, which can be regarded as users and items feature information, to compute the similarity between users or items. Moreover, we propose a Top-K recommender system construction method on the network with trust values computed from users' interest similarity. In our experiments we use the Last fm dataset, and we employ the RMSE and hit-radios benchmarks to evaluate the quality and performance of prediction on single item and Top-K recommendation. We compare our approach with two traditional CF algorithms. The experimental results show that our system has good performance, and it solves the defects of CF and existing Trust-based recommender systems."

However, the data they are applied to usually evolves with time, such as friend graphs in social networks or user interactions with items in recommender systems. This is also the case for knowledge bases, which contain facts such as (US, has president, B. Obama, [2009-2017]) that are valid only at certain points in time. For the problem of link prediction under temporal constraints, i.e., answering queries such as (US, has president, ?, 2012), we propose a solution inspired by the canonical decomposition of tensors of order 4. We introduce new regularization schemes and present an extension of ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) that achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we propose a new dataset for knowledge base completion constructed from Wikidata, larger than previous benchmarks by an order of magnitude, as a new reference for evaluating temporal and non-temporal link prediction methods."

Accuracy and explainability are two core aspects when we evaluate a recommendation model and have become one of the fundamental trade-offs in machine learning. In this paper, we propose to alleviate the trade-off between accuracy and explainability by developing an explainable deep model that combines the advantages of deep learning-based models and existing explainable methods. The basic idea is to build an initial network based on an explainable deep hierarchy (e.g., Microsoft Concept Graph) and improve the model accuracy by optimizing key variables in the hierarchy (e.g., node importance and relevance). To ensure accurate rating prediction, we propose an attentive multi-view learning framework. The framework enables us to handle sparse and noisy data by co-regularizing among different feature levels and combining predictions attentively. To mine readable explanations from the hierarchy, we formulate personalized explanation generation as a constrained tree node selection problem and propose a dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and explainability."

    "abstract": "User-based collaborative filtering is an important technique used in collaborative filtering recommender systems to recommend items based on the opinions of like-minded nearby users, where similarity computation is the critical component. Traditional similarity measures, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and cosine Similarity, mainly focus on the directions of co-related rating vectors and have inherent limitations for recommendations. In addition, CF-based recommendation systems always suffer from the cold-start problem, where users do not have enough co-related ratings for prediction. To address these problems, we propose a novel similarity measure inspired by a physical resonance phenomenon, named resonance similarity (RES). We fully consider different personalized situations in RES by mathematically modeling the consistency of users' rating behaviors, the distances between the users' opinions, and the Jaccard factor with both the co-related and non-related ratings. RES is a cumulative sum of the arithmetic product of these three parts and is optimized using learning parameters from data sets. Results evaluated on six real data sets show that RES is robust against the observed problems and has superior predictive accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art similarity measures on full users', grouped users', and cold-start users' evaluations."

The underlying idea is to recommend highly predicted items that also have been found as reliable ones. We use the deep learning architecture to extract the existing non-linear relations between predictions, reliabilities, and accurate recommendations. The proposed architecture consists of three related stages, providing three stacked abstraction levels: (a) real prediction errors, (b) predicted errors (reliabilities), and (c) predicted ratings (predictions). In turn, each abstraction level requires a learning process: (a) Matrix Factorization from ratings, (b) Multilayer Neural Network fed with real prediction errors and hidden factors, and (c) Multilayer Neural Network fed with reliabilities and hidden factors. A complete set of experiments has been run involving three representative and open datasets and a state-of-the-art baseline. The results show strong prediction improvements and also important recommendation improvements, particularly for the recall quality measure."

    "abstract": "A Recommender System (RS) is an intelligent system that assists users in finding the items of their interest (e.g. books, movies, music) by preventing them to go through huge piles of data available online. In an effort to overcome the data sparsity issue in recommender systems, this research incorporates a content based filtering technique with fuzzy inference system and a conformal prediction approach introducing a new framework called Hybrid Content based Fuzzy Conformal Recommender System (HCF-CRS). The proposed framework is implemented to be used in the domain of movies and it provides quality recommendations to users with a confidence level and an improved accuracy. In our proposed framework, first, a Content Based Filtering (CBF) technique is applied to create a user profile by considering the history of each user. CBF is useful in the situations like: lack of demographic information and the data sparsity problems. Second, a Fuzzy based technique is incorporated to find the similarities and differences between the user profile and the movies in the dataset using a set of fuzzy rules to get a predicted rating for each movie. Third, a Conformal prediction algorithm is implemented to calculate the non-conformity measure between the predicted ratings produced by fuzzy system and the actual ratings from the dataset. A p-value (confidence measure) is computed to give a level of confidence to each recommended item and a bound is set on the confidence level called a significance level \u03b5, according to which the movies only above the specified significance level are recommended to user. By building a confidence centric hybrid conformal recommender system using the content based filtering approach with fuzzy logic and conformal prediction algorithm, the reliability and the accuracy of the system is considerably enhanced. The experiments are evaluated on MovieLens and Movie Tweetings datasets for recommending movies to the users and they are compared with other state-of-the-art recommender systems. Finally, the results confirm that the proposed algorithms perform better than the traditional ones."

One prerequisite to these tasks is the ability to capture the similarity and relatedness between POI types. Intuitively, a spatial search that returns body shops or even gas stations in the absence of auto repair places is still likely to satisfy some user needs while returning planetariums will not. Place hierarchies are frequently used for query expansion, but most of the existing hierarchies are relatively shallow and structured from a single perspective, thereby putting POI types that may be closely related regarding some characteristics far apart from another. This leads to the question of how to learn POI type representations from data. Models such as Word2Vec that produces word embeddings from linguistic contexts are a novel and promising approach as they come with an intuitive notion of similarity. However, the structure of geographic space, e.g., the interactions between POI types, differs substantially from linguistics. In this work, we present a novel method to augment the spatial contexts of POI types using a distance-binned, information-theoretic approach to generate embeddings. We demonstrate that our work outperforms Word2Vec and other models using three different evaluation tasks and strongly correlates with human assessments of POI type similarity. We published the resulting embeddings for 570 place types as well as a collection of human similarity assessments online for others to use."

    "abstract": "Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and in most cases steroid hormone-producing tumor with variable prognosis. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide clinicians with best possible evidence-based recommendations for clinical management of patients with ACC based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. We predefined four main clinical questions, which we judged as particularly important for the management of ACC patients and performed systematic literature searches: (A) What is needed to diagnose an ACC by histopathology? (B) Which are the best prognostic markers in ACC? (C) Is adjuvant therapy able to prevent recurrent disease or reduce mortality after radical resection? (D) What is the best treatment option for macroscopically incompletely resected, recurrent or metastatic disease? Other relevant questions were discussed within the group. Selected Recommendations: (i) We recommend that all patients with suspected and proven ACC are discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team meeting. (ii) We recommend that every patient with (suspected) ACC should undergo careful clinical assessment, detailed endocrine work-up to identify autonomous hormone excess and adrenal-focused imaging. (iii) We recommend that adrenal surgery for (suspected) ACC should be performed only by surgeons experienced in adrenal and oncological surgery aiming at a complete en bloc resection (including resection of oligo-metastatic disease). (iv) We suggest that all suspected ACC should be reviewed by an expert adrenal pathologist using the Weiss score and providing Ki67 index. (v) We suggest adjuvant mitotane treatment in patients after radical surgery that have a perceived high risk of recurrence (ENSAT stage III, or R1 resection, or Ki67 &gt;10%). (vi) For advanced ACC not amenable to complete surgical resection, local therapeutic measures (e.g. radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, chemoembolization) are of particular value. However, we suggest against the routine use of adrenal surgery in case of widespread metastatic disease. In these patients, we recommend either mitotane monotherapy or mitotane, etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin depending on prognostic parameters. In selected patients with a good response, surgery may be subsequently considered. (vii) In patients with recurrent disease and a disease-free interval of at least 12 months, in whom a complete resection/ablation seems feasible, we recommend surgery or alternatively other local therapies. Furthermore, we offer detailed recommendations about the management of mitotane treatment and other supportive therapies. Finally, we suggest directions for future research."

The main goal of traditional collaborative filtering techniques is improvement of the accuracy of recommendation.

On the other hand, when we consider users' satisfaction, they are not necessarily good because of the lack of discovery. In our work, we infer items that a user does not know by calculating the similarity of users or items based on information about what items users already know. We seek to recommend items that the user would probably like and does not know by combining the above method and the most popular method of collaborative filtering."

    "abstract": "Cold-start problem is still a very challenging problem in recommender systems. Fortunately, the interactions of the cold-start users in the auxiliary source domain can help cold-start recommendations in the target domain. How to transfer user's preferences from the source domain to the target domain, is the key issue in Cross-domain Recommendation (CDR) which is a promising solution to deal with the cold-start problem. Most existing methods model a common preference bridge to transfer preferences for all users. Intuitively, since preferences vary from user to user, the preference bridges of different users should be different. Along this line, we propose a novel framework named Personalized Transfer of User Preferences for Cross-domain Recommendation (PTUPCDR). Specifically, a meta network fed with users' characteristic embeddings is learned to generate personalized bridge functions to achieve personalized transfer of preferences for each user. To learn the meta network stably, we employ a task-oriented optimization procedure. With the meta-generated personalized bridge function, the user's preference embedding in the source domain can be transformed into the target domain, and the transformed user preference embedding can be utilized as the initial embedding for the cold-start user in the target domain. Using large real-world datasets, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PTUPCDR on both cold-start and warm-start stages. The code has been available at https://github.com/easezyc/WSDM2022-PTUPCDR."

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are often trained on datasets that contain sensitive information such as individuals' shopping transactions, personal contacts, and medical records. An increasingly important line of work therefore has sought to train neural networks subject to privacy constraints that are specified by differential privacy or its divergence-based relaxations. These privacy definitions, however, have weaknesses in handling certain important primitives (composition and subsampling), thereby giving loose or complicated privacy analyses of training neural networks. In this paper, we consider a recently proposed privacy definition termed f-differential privacy [18] for a refined privacy analysis of training neural networks. Leveraging the appealing properties of f-differential privacy in handling composition and subsampling, this paper derives analytically tractable expressions for the privacy guarantees of both stochastic gradient descent and Adam used in training deep neural networks, without the need of developing sophisticated techniques as [3] did. Our results demonstrate that the f-differential privacy framework allows for a new privacy analysis that improves on the prior analysis [3], which in turn suggests tuning certain parameters of neural networks for a better prediction accuracy without violating the privacy budget. These theoretically derived improvements are confirmed by our experiments in a range of tasks in image classification, text classification, and recommender systems. Python code to calculate the privacy cost for these experiments is publicly available in the TensorFlow Privacy library."

Specifically, we hypothesize that users with different levels of domain knowledge prefer different types of PE. While domain experts reported higher satisfaction and perceived usefulness with attribute-based PE (i.e., indicating preference levels for the domain-related attributes), novices preferred case-based PE (i.e., indicating the preference for specific examples, from which attribute-preferences can then be implicitly calculated). The paper discusses the decision-theoretical principles that are believed to lead to this distinction, as well as an experiment that provides substantial evidence for the hypothesis. Consequently, we introduce the idea of adapting the method of PE to users' domain knowledge on the fly using click stream data."

Recent research has confirmed and measured such biases, and proposed methods to avoid them. The fundamental question remains open though whether popularity is really a bias we should avoid or not; whether it could be a useful and reliable signal in recommendation, or it may be unfairly rewarded by the experimental biases. We address this question at a formal level by identifying and modeling the conditions that can determine the answer, in terms of dependencies between key random variables, involving item rating, discovery and relevance. We find conditions that guarantee popularity to be effective or quite the opposite, and for the measured metric values to reflect a true effectiveness, or qualitatively deviate from it. We exemplify and confirm the theoretical findings with empirical results. We build a crowdsourced dataset devoid of the usual biases displayed by common publicly available data, in which we illustrate contradictions between the accuracy that would be measured in a common biased offline experimental setting, and the actual accuracy that can be measured with unbiased observations."

    "title": "kNN CF",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems, based on collaborative filtering, draw their strength from techniques that manipulate a set of user-rating profiles in order to compute predicted ratings of unrated items. There are a wide range of techniques that can be applied to this problem; however, the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm has become the dominant method used in this context. Much research to date has focused on improving the performance of this algorithm, without considering the properties that emerge from manipulating the user data in this way. In order to understand the effect of kNN on a user-rating dataset, the algorithm can be viewed as a process that generates a graph, where nodes are users and edges connect similar users: the algorithm generates an implicit social network amongst the system subscribers. Temporal updates of the recommender system will impose changes on the graph. In this work we analyse user-user kNN graphs from a temporal perspective, retrieving characteristics such as dataset growth, the evolution of similarity between pairs of users, the volatility of user neighbourhoods over time, and emergent properties of the entire graph as the algorithm parameters change. These insights explain why certain kNN parameters and similarity measures outperform others, and show that there is a surprising degree of structural similarity between these graphs and explicit user social networks."

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems are becoming ubiquitous in many settings and take many forms, from product recommendation in e-commerce stores, to query suggestions in search engines, to friend recommendation in social networks. Current research directions which are largely based upon supervised learning from historical data appear to be showing diminishing returns with a lot of practitioners report a discrepancy between improvements in offline metrics for supervised learning and the online performance of the newly proposed models. One possible reason is that we are using the wrong paradigm: when looking at the long-term cycle of collecting historical performance data, creating a new version of the recommendation model, A/B testing it and then rolling it out. We see that there a lot of commonalities with the reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where the agent observes the environment and acts upon it in order to change its state towards better states (states with higher rewards). To this end we introduce RecoGym, an RL environment for recommendation, which is defined by a model of user traffic patterns on e-commerce and the users response to recommendations on the publisher websites. We believe that this is an important step forward for the field of recommendation systems research, that could open up an avenue of collaboration between the recommender systems and reinforcement learning communities and lead to better alignment between offline and online performance metrics."

    "abstract": "As an important way to alleviate information overload, a recommender system aims to filter out irrelevant information for users and provides them items that they may be interested in. In recent years, an increasing amount of works have been proposed to introduce auxiliary information in recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems. Among them, heterogeneous information networks (HIN)-based recommender systems provide a unified approach to fuse various auxiliary information, which can be combined with mainstream recommendation algorithms to effectively enhance the performance and interpretability of models, and thus have been applied in many kinds of recommendation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic survey of HIN-based recommender systems, including four aspects: concepts, methods, applications, and resources. Specifically, we firstly introduce the concepts related to recommender systems, heterogeneous information networks and HIN-based recommendation. Secondly, we present more than 70 methods categorized according to models or application scenarios, and describe representative methods symbolically. Thirdly, we summarize the benchmark datasets and open source code. Finally, we discuss several potential research directions and conclude our survey."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in recommender systems. Despite significant progress in this field, there still remain numerous avenues to explore. Indeed, this paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To that end, in this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the existing travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST) model. This TAST model can represent travel packages and tourists by different topic distributions, where the topic extraction is conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, based on this topic model representation, we propose a cocktail approach to generate the lists for personalized travel package recommendation. Furthermore, we extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in each travel group. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model, the TRAST model, and the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel package data. Experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is, thus, much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation. Also, by considering tourist relationships, the TRAST model can be used as an effective assessment for travel group formation."

    "abstract": "Abstract With the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the needs of data and information sharing within cities, smart city aims to provide value-added services to improve citizens\u2019 quality of life. But, currently city planners/developers are faced with inadequate contextual information on the dimensions of smart city required to achieve a sustainable society. Therefore, in achieving sustainable society, there is need for stakeholders to make strategic decisions on how to implement smart city initiatives. Besides, it is required to specify the smart city dimensions to be adopted in making cities smarter for sustainability attainment. But, only a few methods such as big data, internet of things, cloud computing, etc. have been employed to support smart city attainment. Thus, this study integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) as an artificial intelligence technique to develop a recommender system towards promoting smart city planning. CBR provides suggestions on smart city dimensions to be adopted by city planners/decision-makers in making cities smarter and sustainable. Accordingly, survey data were collected from 115 respondents to evaluate the applicability of the implemented CBR recommender system in relation to how the system provides best practice recommendations and retaining of smart city initiatives. Results from descriptive and exploratory factor analyses suggest that the developed system is applicable in supporting smart city adoption. Besides, findings from this study are expected to provide valuable insights for practitioners to develop more practical strategies and for researchers to better understand smart city dimensions."

While most of the existing collaborative filtering methods focus on explicit, multi-class settings (e.g., 1-5 stars in movie recommendation), many real-world applications actually belong to the one-class setting where user feedback is implicitly expressed (e.g., views in news recommendation and video recommendation). The main challenges in such one-class setting include the ambiguity of the unobserved examples and the sparseness of existing positive examples."

Given a sequence of interacted items, existing DNN-based sequential recommenders commonly embed each item into a unique vector to support subsequent computations of the user interest. However, due to the potentially large number of items, the over-parameterised item embedding matrix of a sequential recommender has become a memory bottleneck for efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments, e.g., smartphones and other edge devices. Furthermore, we observe that the widely-used multi-head self-attention, though being effective in modelling sequential dependencies among items, heavily relies on redundant attention units to fully capture both global and local item-item transition patterns within a sequence."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are intelligent data mining applications that deal with the issue of information overload significantly. The available literature discusses several methodologies to generate recommendations and proposes different techniques in accordance with users' needs. The majority of the work in the recommender system domain focuses on increasing the recommendation accuracy by employing several proposed approaches where the main motive remains to maximize the accuracy of recommendations while ignoring other design objectives, such as a user's an item's context. The biggest challenge for a recommender system is to produce meaningful recommendations by using contextual user-item rating information. A context is a vast term that may consider various aspects; for example, a user's social circle, time, mood, location, weather, company, day type, an item's genre, location, and language. Typically, the rating behavior of users varies under different contexts. From this line of research, we have proposed a new algorithm, namely Kernel Context Recommender System, which is a flexible, fast, and accurate kernel mapping framework that recognizes the importance of context and incorporates the contextual information using kernel trick while making predictions. We have benchmarked our proposed algorithm with pre- and post-filtering approaches as they have been the favorite approaches in the literature to solve the context-aware recommendation problem. Our experiments reveal that considering the contextual information can increase the performance of a system and provide better, relevant, and meaningful results on various evaluation metrics."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are becoming tools of choice to select the online information relevant to a given user. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users who have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model in a principled way. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users."

    "title": "Your neighbors affect your ratings",
    "abstract": "Rating prediction is to predict the preference rating of a user to an item that she has not rated before. Using the business review data from Yelp, in this paper, we study business rating prediction. A business here can be a restaurant, a shopping mall or other kind of businesses. Different from most other types of items that have been studied in various recommender systems (e.g., movie, song, book), a business physically exists at a geographical location, and most businesses have geographical neighbors within walking distance. When a user visits a business, there is a good chance that she walks by its neighbors. Through data analysis, we observe that there exists weak positive correlation between a business's ratings and its neighbors' ratings, regardless of the categories of businesses. Based on this observation, we assume that a user's rating to a business is determined by both the intrinsic characteristics of the business and the extrinsic characteristics of its geographical neighbors. Using the widely adopted latent factor model for rating prediction, in our proposed solution, we use two kinds of latent factors to model a business: one for its intrinsic characteristics and the other for its extrinsic characteristics. The latter encodes the neighborhood influence of this business to its geographical neighbors. In our experiments, we show that by incorporating geographical neighborhood influences, much lower prediction error is achieved than the state-of-the-art models including Biased MF, SVD++, and Social MF. The prediction error is further reduced by incorporating influences from business category and review content."

A variety of recommendation frameworks have been proposed, including some based on non-sequential models, such as association rules and clusters, and some based on sequential models, such as sequential or navigational patterns. Our recent studies have suggested that the structural characteristics of Web sites, such as the site topology and the degree of connectivity, have a significant impact on the relative performance of recommendation models based on association rules, contiguous and non-contiguous sequential patterns. In this paper, we present a framework for a hybrid Web personalization system that can intelligently switch among different recommendation models, based on the degree of connectivity and the current location of the user within the site. We have conducted a detailed evaluation based on real Web usage data from three sites with different structural characteristics. Our results show that the hybrid system selects less constrained models such as frequent itemsets when the user is navigating portions of the site with a higher degree of connectivity, while sequential recommendation models are chosen for deeper navigational depths and lower degrees of connectivity. The comparative evaluation also indicates that the overall performance of hybrid system in terms of precision and coverage is better than the recommendation systems based on any of the individual models."

A few problems need to be solved such as sparse data and low recommended accuracy. Collaborative filtering is a mature algorithm in the recommended systems, but there are still some problems. In this paper, a novel collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on user correlation and evolutionary clustering is presented. Firstly, score matrix is pre-processed with normalization and dimension reduction, to obtain denser score data. Based on these processed data, clustering principle is generated and dynamic evolutionary clustering is implemented. Secondly, the search for the nearest neighbors with highest similar interest is considered. A measurement about the relationship between users is proposed, called user correlation, which applies the satisfaction of users and the potential information. In each user group, user correlation is applied to choose the nearest neighbors to predict ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using the Movielens dataset. Diversity experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has outstanding performance in predicted accuracy and recommended precision."

The tremendous growth of the number of customers and products in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems in which high quality recommendations are required and more recommendations per second for millions of customers and products need to be performed. Thus, the improvement of scalability and efficiency of collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms become increasingly important and difficult. In this paper, we developed and implemented a scaling-up item-based collaborative filtering algorithm on MapReduce, by splitting the three most costly computations in the proposed algorithm into four Map-Reduce phases, each of which can be independently executed on different nodes in parallel. We also proposed efficient partition strategies not only to enable the parallel computation in each Map-Reduce phase but also to maximize data locality to minimize the communication cost. Experimental results effectively showed the good performance in scalability and efficiency of the item-based CF algorithm on a Hadoop cluster."

The ADSS is a software system being developed at DSTO for the automatic detection of targets in SAR imagery. We outline the motivations, theory and justifications of the various approaches so that educated comparisons and evaluations can be made. Most current research on ship detection is based on detecting the ship itself rather than its wake. Detection of ship wakes is not addressed in any depth. Ship detection systems generally consist of several stages: land masking; preprocessing; prescreening; and discrimination. We consider each of these stages in turn and discuss the various algorithms which have been used. A basic system for low to medium resolution single channel SAR imagery is recommended and suggestions for improvements and alternatives are made."

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most popular recommendation techniques. However, with the rapid growth of the Web in terms of users and items, majority of the RS using CF technique suffer from problems like data sparsity and scalability. In this paper, we present a Recommender System based on data clustering techniques to deal with the scalability problem associated with the recommendation task. We use different voting systems as algorithms to combine opinions from multiple users for recommending items of interest to the new user. The proposed work use DBSCAN clustering algorithm for clustering the users, and then implement voting algorithms to recommend items to the user depending on the cluster into which it belongs. The idea is to partition the users of the RS using clustering algorithm and apply the Recommendation Algorithm separately to each partition. Our system recommends item to a user in a specific cluster only using the rating statistics of the other users of that cluster. This helps us to reduce the running time of the algorithm as we avoid computations over the entire data. Our objective is to improve the running time as well as maintain an acceptable recommendation quality. We have tested the algorithm on the Netflix prize dataset."

Recently, the synergy between context aware computing and collaborative filtering is leading to enhance recommender systems with capabilities always nearer to user needs. Specifically, in the domain of tourism it is useful to proactively suggest right sets of attractive locations, events and so on. This work defines a context aware recommender system aimed at suggesting pertinent points of interest (POIs) to tourists. In particular, the approach is strongly based on the synergy between soft computing and data mining techniques. The general framework integrates user profiles, history of social networking and POIs data. Then by defining collaborative filtering approach on the history meaningful POIs are extracted. Indeed, soft computing techniques are mainly applied in order to support activity of unsupervised users and POIs classification. On the other hand, data mining techniques are exploited in order to extract rules able to associate user profile and context features with an eligible set of recommendable POIs. Experimental results show performance in terms of recommendations accuracy."

To solve this problem, the paper proposed a personalized recommendation algorithm combining slope one scheme and user based collaborative filtering.

We conducted our study with the launch of a new version of the MovieLens movie recommender that supports multiple recommender algorithms and allows users to choose the algorithm they want to provide their recommendations. We examine log data from user interactions with this new feature to under-stand whether and how users switch among recommender algorithms, and select a final algorithm to use. We also look at the properties of the algorithms as they were experienced by users and examine their relationships to user behavior. We found that a substantial portion of our user base (25%) used the recommender-switching feature. The majority of users who used the control only switched algorithms a few times, trying a few out and settling down on an algorithm that they would leave alone. The largest number of users prefer a matrix factorization algorithm, followed closely by item-item collaborative filtering; users selected both of these algorithms much more often than they chose a non-personalized mean recommender. The algorithms did produce measurably different recommender lists for the users in the study, but these differences were not directly predictive of user choice."

This resulted in an enormous amount of online available information, products and services that made it a challenge for people to find what is really interesting to them. This thesis addresses three solutions that can be used to support people in finding interesting items, based on the three main processes of a personalized information system: selecting, structuring and presenting information. For the selection of information, a framework is described for the development of hybrid recommender systems that switches between prediction techniques based on the most up-to-date knowledge about the user, other users, the item and other items. Experiments with the framework show that this increases the accuracy of interest predictions. To structure information, a method is investigated that makes it easier for people to find interesting information by structuring items according to the possible goals people have. Experiments with this goal-based structuring method show that goal-based structuring supports people in finding interesting information even more than recommendations. However, it takes people time to get used to goal-based structuring. Finally, it addresses those user interface aspects that are specific to recommender systems, namely presenting predictions, presenting explanations and providing feedback. A user-centered design approach shows that people prefer traditional ways of presenting predictions, that they believe explanations about predictions are important and that they prefer to not give explicit feedback but have a system derive their interests implicitly. However, if explicit feedback is required, it should be acquired in a manner similar to how predictions are presented."

However, recommendation accuracy is tied with diversity in a delicate trade-off and the potential of graph convolutions to improve the latter is unexplored. Here, we develop a model that learns joint convolutional representations from a nearest neighbor and a furthest neighbor graph to establish a novel accuracy-diversity trade-off for recommender systems. The nearest neighbor graph connects entities (users or items) based on their similarities and is responsible for improving accuracy, while the furthest neighbor graph connects entities based on their dissimilarities and is responsible for diversifying recommendations. The information between the two convolutional modules is balanced already in the training phase through a regularizer inspired by multi-kernel learning. We evaluate the joint convolutional model on three benchmark datasets with different degrees of sparsity. The proposed method can either trade accuracy to improve substantially the catalog coverage or the diversity within the list; or improve both by a lesser amount. Compared with accuracy-oriented graph convolutional approaches, the proposed model shows diversity gains up to seven times by trading as little as 1% in accuracy. Compared with alternative accuracy-diversity trade-off solutions, the joint graph convolutional model retains the highest accuracy while offering a handle to increase diversity. To our knowledge, this is the first work proposing an accuracy-diversity trade-off with graph convolutions and opens the doors to learning over graphs approaches for improving such trade-off."

    "abstract": "Recent work has focused on new measures that are beyond the accuracy of recommender systems. Serendipity, which is one of these measures, is defined as a measure that indicates how the recommender system can find unexpected and useful items for users. In this paper, we propose a Fusion-based Recommender System that aims to improve the serendipity of recommender systems. The system is based on the novel notion that the system finds new items, which have the mixed features of two user-input items, produced by mixing the two items together. The system consists of item-fusion methods and scoring methods. The item-fusion methods generate a recommendation list based on mixed features of two user-input items. Scoring methods are used to rank the recommendation list. This paper describes these methods and gives experimental results."

    "title": "Multiobjective Personalized Recommendation Algorithm Using Extreme Point Guided Evolutionary Computation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems suggest items to users based on their potential interests, and they are important to alleviate the search and selection pressures induced by the increasing item information. Classical recommender systems mainly focus on the accuracy of recommendation. However, with the increase of the diversified demands of users, multiple metrics which may conflict with each other have to be considered in modern recommender systems, especially for the personalized recommender system. In this paper, we design a personalized recommendation system considering the three conflicting objectives, i.e., the accuracy, diversity, and novelty. Then, to let the system provide more comprehensive recommended items, we present a multiobjective personalized recommendation algorithm using extreme point guided evolutionary computation (called MOEA\u2010EPG). The proposed MOEA\u2010EPG is guided by three extreme points and its crossover operator is designed for better satisfying the demands of users. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of MOEA\u2010EPG when compared to some state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art recommendation algorithms in terms of accuracy, diversity, and novelty on recommendation."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely advocated as a way of coping with the problem of information overload for knowledge workers. Given this, multiple recommendation methods have been developed. However, it has been shown that no one technique is best for all users in all situations. Thus we believe that effective recommender systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and that some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate the various recommendations so that only the best of them (from whatever source) are presented to the user. To this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role. Specifically, this paper presents the principled design of such a marketplace; detailing the auction protocol and reward mechanism and analyzing the rational bidding strategies of the individual recommendation agents."

Visitors of museums are often overwhelmed by the information available in the space they are exploring. Therefore, finding relevant artworks to see in a limited amount of time is a crucial task. In this paper, we present a recommender system for mobile devices that (1) adapts to the users profiles and (2) is sensitive to their context (location, time, expertise, etc.). Our system aims to improve the visitors' experience and help them build their tours on-site according to their preferences and constraints. We first describe our recommendation framework, which consists in a hybrid recommendation system. It combines a semantic approach for the representation of museum domain using ontologies and thesauruses with a semantically-enhanced collaborative filtering method. Then, we present a contextual post filtering that enables the generation of a highly personalized tour based on the physical environment, the location of the visitors and the time they want to spend in the museum."

Research on systems and algorithms in this area has flourished, leading to novel techniques for personalization and recommendation. The evaluation of recommender systems, however, has not seen similar progress---techniques have changed little since the advent of recommender systems, when evaluation methodologies were \"borrowed\" from related research areas. As an effort to move evaluation methodology forward, this paper describes a production recommender system infrastructure that allows research systems to be evaluated in situ, by real-world metrics such as user clickthrough. We present an analysis of one month of interactions with this infrastructure and share our findings."

Typically, recommender systems compute choice sets of the top-k ranked products. Based on the actual user choices, the system tunes its prediction function hereafter. However, the existence of decision biases such as position, decoy, or framing effects is disregarded when making recommendations or exploiting implicit user feedback such as choice behavior. In order to purposefully avoid or apply the persuasive traits that are inherent to the presentation of product recommendations, it is crucial to understand the relative strength and interaction between these effects in online environments. This article contributes an experimental analysis of the impact of different decision biases like decoy or position effects as well as risk aversion in positive decision frames on users' choice behavior. The findings document a strong dominance of risk aversion strategies and the need for awareness of these effects."

    "abstract": "Learning feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction in recommender systems. In most existing deep learning models, feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated. However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can automatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models with computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to convergence. In the search stage, instead of searching over a discrete set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by introducing the architecture parameters. By implementing a regularized optimizer over the architecture parameters, the model can automatically identify and remove the redundant feature interactions during the training process of the model. In the re-train stage, we keep the architecture parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the performance. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one private) demonstrate that AutoFIS can significantly improve various FM based models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto the training platform of Huawei App Store recommendation service, where a 10-day online A/B test demonstrated that AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by 20.3% and 20.1% in terms of CTR and CVR respectively."

RSs are developed based on user textual reviews, ratings, and comparative opinions. RSs for social media resources, such as blogs, forums, social network websites, social bookmarking websites, video portals, and chat portals help users to collaborate effectively. Social media resources are used in the RS for recommending contents, articles, news, e-commerce products, and users. Although research on social media in RSs has increased annually, comprehensive literature review and classification of these RS studies are limited and must, therefore, be improved. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the social media RS on research articles published from 2011 to 2015 by exploiting a methodological decision analysis in six aspects, including recommendation approaches, research domains, and data sets used in each domain, data mining techniques, recommendation type, and the use of performance measures. A total of 61 articles are reviewed among the initial 434 articles on RS research published in Web of Science and Scopus between 2011 and 2015. To accomplish the aim of this paper, a comprehensive review and analysis was performed on extracted articles to explore various recommendation approaches which are used in the RS. In addition, various social media domains are identified, where RSs have been employed. In each identified domain, publicly available data sets are also reported. Furthermore, various data mining techniques, recommendation types, and performance measures are also analyzed and reviewed in technical aspects. Finally, potential open research directions are also presented for future researchers intended to work in social media RS domain."

    "abstract": "Deep recommender systems have achieved remarkable improvements in recent years. Despite its superior ranking precision, the running efficiency and memory consumption turn out to be severe bottlenecks in reality. To overcome both limitations, we propose LightRec, a lightweight recommender system which enjoys fast online inference and economic memory consumption. The backbone of LightRec is a total of B codebooks, each of which is composed of W latent vectors, known as codewords. On top of such a structure, LightRec will have an item represented as additive composition of B codewords, which are optimally selected from each of the codebooks. To effectively learn the codebooks from data, we devise an end-to-end learning workflow, where challenges on the inherent differentiability and diversity are conquered by the proposed techniques. In addition, to further improve the representation quality, several distillation strategies are employed, which better preserves user-item relevance scores and relative ranking orders. LightRec is extensively evaluated with four real-world datasets, which gives rise to two empirical findings: 1) compared with those the state-of-the-art lightweight baselines, LightRec achieves over 11% relative improvements in terms of recall performance; 2) compared to conventional recommendation algorithms, LightRec merely incurs negligible accuracy degradation while leads to more than 27x speedup in top-k recommendation."

    "title": "Secure Multi-Party Protocols for Item-Based Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of domains such as movies, music, news, products, restaurants, etc. While a typical recommender system bases its recommendations solely on users' preference data collected by the system itself, the quality of recommendations can significantly be improved if several recommender systems (or vendors) share their data. However, such data sharing poses significant privacy and security challenges, both to the vendors and the users. In this paper we propose secure protocols for distributed item-based Collaborative Filtering. Our protocols allow to compute both the predicted ratings of items and their predicted rankings, without compromising privacy nor predictions' accuracy. Unlike previous solutions in which the secure protocols are executed solely by the vendors, our protocols assume the existence of a mediator that performs intermediate computations on encrypted data supplied by the vendors. Such a mediated setting is advantageous over the non-mediated one since it enables each vendor to communicate solely with the mediator. This yields reduced communication costs and it allows each vendor to issue recommendations to its clients without being dependent on the availability and willingness of the other vendors to collaborate."

    "title": "Opinion Dynamics-Based Group Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "With the accessibility to information, users often face the problem of selecting one item (a product or a service) from a huge search space. This problem is known as information overload. Recommender systems (RSs) personalize content to a user's interests to help them select the right item in information overload scenarios. Group RSs (GRSs) recommend items to a group of users. In GRSs, a recommendation is usually computed by a simple aggregation method for individual information. However, the aggregations are rigid and overlook certain group features, such as the relationships between the group members' preferences. In this paper, it is proposed a GRS based on opinion dynamics that considers these relationships using a smart weights matrix to drive the process. In some groups, opinions do not agree, hence the weights matrix is modified to reach a consensus value. The impact of ensuring agreed recommendations is evaluated through a set of experiments. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis studies its behavior. Compared to existing group recommendation models and frameworks, the proposal based on opinion dynamics would have the following advantages: 1) flexible aggregation method; 2) member relationships; and 3) agreed recommendations."

    "title": "CATN",
    "abstract": "In a large recommender system, the products (or items) could be in many different categories or domains. Given two relevant domains (e.g., Book and Movie), users may have interactions with items in one domain but not in the other domain. To the latter, these users are considered as cold-start users. How to effectively transfer users' preferences based on their interactions from one domain to the other relevant domain, is the key issue in cross-domain recommendation. Inspired by the advances made in review-based recommendation, we propose to model user preference transfer at aspect-level derived from reviews. To this end, we propose a cross-domain recommendation framework via aspect transfer network for cold-start users (named CATN). CATN is devised to extract multiple aspects for each user and each item from their review documents, and learn aspect correlations across domains with an attention mechanism. In addition, we further exploit auxiliary reviews from like-minded users to enhance a user's aspect representations. Then, an end-to-end optimization framework is utilized to strengthen the robustness of our model. On real-world datasets, the proposed CATN outperforms SOTA models significantly in terms of rating prediction accuracy. Further analysis shows that our model is able to reveal user aspect connections across domains at a fine level of granularity, making the recommendation explainable."

Empirical results illustrate that the method can detect profile injection attacks more accurately compared with prior works."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the explosion of learning materials in the web-based educational systems has caused difficulty of locating appropriate learning materials to learners. A personalized recommendation is an enabling mechanism to overcome information overload occurred in the new learning environments and deliver suitable materials to learners. Since users express their opinions based on some specific attributes of items, this paper proposes a hybrid recommender system for learning materials based on their attributes to improve the accuracy and quality of recommendation. The presented system has two main modules: explicit attribute-based recommender and implicit attribute-based recommender. In the first module, weights of implicit or latent attributes of materials for learner are considered as chromosomes in genetic algorithm then this algorithm optimizes the weights according to historical rating. Then, recommendation is generated by Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm (NNA) using the optimized weight vectors implicit attributes that represent the opinions of learners. In the second, preference matrix (PM) is introduced that can model the interests of learner based on explicit attributes of learning materials in a multidimensional information model. Then, a new similarity measure between PMs is introduced and recommendations are generated by NNA. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms current algorithms on accuracy measures and can alleviate some problems such as cold-start and sparsity."

Springer-Verlag, New York. 2003. 483 pp. ISBN 0-387-95535-6. $69.95.Reviewed by B Brogliato (INRA, 655 Ave De L'Europe, Saint Ismier, 38334, France).This mathematically oriented book is dedicated to the modeling and control of a class of nonlinear mechanical systems, namely mechanical systems subject to nonholonomic (or non integrable) bilateral constraints. It is known that the control of such nonlinear systems requires specific tools, as they may not be stabilizable with continuous feedbacks, as a consequence of Brockett's necessary conditions. Such problems have received considerable attention in the applied mathematics, mechanics, and systems and control communities, for many years. Therefore, this is a topic of major importance. The audience will mainly consist of graduate students, researchers, either working in this field or with a sufficiently advanced mathematical background (especially differential geometry tools). The book starts with an introductory chapter with many examples treated in detail. The next two chapters are devoted to presenting the mathematical tools needed to study such systems. This material will certainly be hard to follow for those who have no acquaintance in differential geometry and its applications to mechanics. However, in view of the literature on the subject, understanding the basics from geometry seems to be mandatory for someone who wants to understand the control of such mechanical systems. The fourth chapter is dedicated to nonlinear control theory, still with an emphasis on geometry. Controllability, stability and stabilization are reviewed, and the chapter ends with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian control systems. The fifth and sixth chapters are devoted to nonholonomic systems, their dynamics and their control. Stabilization techniques are explained, like time-varying and nonsmooth controllers. Here one can regret that the bibliography omits C Samson, one of the first contributors to the field and who introduced time-varying controllers for the control of chained systems in the paper Velocity and torque feedback control of a nonholonomic cart, in Advanced Robot Control, Proceedings of the International Workshop on Nonlinear and Adaptive Control: Issues in Robotics, Grenoble, France, November 21-23, 1990, Springer Verlag LNCIS 162. Samson's paper Control of chained systems: Application to path following and time-varying point stabilization, IEEE Trans on Automatic Control, Volume 40, pp 64-77, 1995, would have also been welcome in the bibliography. Chapter 7 deals with optimal control and variational principles. The eighth chapter concerns stability analysis with energy arguments (generalization of the Lejeune-Dirichlet theorem on stability of fixed points). In a logical way the last chapter is devoted to energy-based control and stabilization. There are many other books that cover the topic of nonholonomic mechanical systems control in one or two chapters (for instance Sastry's book in the same Springer's series, or the book Theory of Robot Control, Springer CCE Series, 1996). But Nonholonomic Mechanics and Control is entirely dedicated to this topic and covers the aspects of modeling, analysis and control. It clearly belongs to the realm of geometry-oriented works in mechanics or control. The book is well organized, contains many examples and exercises, and can be recommended to all researchers working in the field (applied mathematics, mechanics or control)."

    "title": "Personalization and privacy",
    "abstract": "Personalization has been a hot topic or nearly a decade now, and many new products and advanced algorithms have emerged in that time. Several companies now sell tools such as recommender systems, which take input about users and products and generate recommendations about which products the users will like best. At their best, recommenders can be wonderful tools for users, helping them sort through myriad items they could read, buy, or watch to select those few that are most valuable to them. The algorithms that power these systems have evolved dramatically, and the best can produce rapid recommendations over data sets of millions of users and hundreds of thousands of products. The other edge of the sword is that recommender systems provide perfect tools for marketers and others to invade users' privacy. After all, recommenders; seek to learn everything about our preferences, including what we like to read, what we like to buy, how much money we spend, and what influences us to spend it. How a recommender deals with privacy decides whether its-users view it,as a boon or a bane. If the recommender only uses this information to help us find items to purchase on a Web site, we will probably value the feature - it might even bring us back to shop there again. On the other hand, if the Web site sells our information to other companies, so they can more effectively bother us. with phone calls at dinner time, we'll probably feel our privacy has been invaded. Privacy is a critical issue for recommender systems. In the end, personalization is an important factor in developing effective Web sites because it creates a user experience that is both compelling and sticky. The experience is compelling because it helps users find exactly the information, products, and services they need. It is sticky because a personalized Web site trains itself over time to serve its users better, which makes those users less likely to go to a new site that they would have to train all over again."

These cluster values are then passed to the genetic algorithm based weighted similarity measure to find the similarity between the clustered values and obtaining optimal similarity metrics.

The results obtained show an improvement in the quality of the recommender system."

A variety of techniques, mainly including eligible rule selection and multiple rules combination, have been developed to create effective recommendation. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to the scalability concern of rule-based recommendation methods. However, the computational complexity of rule-based methods shall increase drastically with the growth of both online customers and rules, which are usually several millions in typical e-commerce platforms. Moreover, the dynamic change of users\u2019 actions requires rule-based methods make recommendations in nearly real-time, which further highlights the scalability issue of rule-based recommender systems. In this article, we present a distributed framework that can scale different association-rule-based recommendation methods in a unified way. Specifically, based on the summarization of existing rule-based approaches, a generic tree-type structure is defined to store separate kinds of patterns, and an efficient algorithm is designed for mining eligible patterns along with computing recommendation scores. To handle the ever-increasing number of online customers, a distributed framework is proposed, where two load-balanced strategies for partitioning tree are put forward to fit sparse and dense data, respectively. Extensive experiments on five real-life data sets demonstrate that the efficiency of association-rule-based recommender systems can be significantly improved by the proposed framework."

    "title": "Using Context Similarity for Service Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been successfully used to address the problem of information overload, where consumers of goods and services have too many choices and overwhelming amount of information about each choice. Here we focus on service recommendation and demonstrate the need for using multiple criteria regarding service qualities, and the need to consider multiple contextual dimensions regarding the expected use of that service. These two requirements are not considered together by existing service recommenders systems, motivating our work on an approach which unifies both. To make such an approach precise and effective in situations of sparse feedback, we need a reliable scalar measure for context similarity when dealing with categorical context dimensions. This need underpins the main contribution of this paper - demonstrating that concept abduction provides such a reliable measure for context similarity when the categories of a context dimension are defined as concepts in an ontology. We position this contribution within a proposed multi-context and multi-criteria approach for service recommendation based on collaborative filtering. Using experiments over a real-world dataset, we demonstrate how the concept abduction-based context similarity measure can be used to address the sparsity of data within a single context segment by allowing us to use rankings from context segments nearby."

Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts."

    "abstract": "Context-aware recommender system (CARS) is a highly researched and implemented way of providing a personalized service that helps users to find their desired content. One of the remaining issues is how to decide which contextual information to acquire and how to incorporate it into CARS. While the relevant contextual information will improve the recommendations, the irrelevant contextual information could have a negative impact on the recommendation accuracy. By testing the independence between the contextual variable on the users' ratings for items, we can detect its relevance and impact on the feedback for the item consumed in that specific context. In this article, we propose several new theoretical concepts that should help deciding which information to use, as well as a methodology for detecting which contextual information contributes to explaining the variance in the ratings, based on statistical testing. The experiment was conducted on the real movie dataset that contains 12 different pieces of contextual information. We used two statistical tests with power analysis for the detection, and three contextualized matrix-factorization algorithms with slightly different reasoning for the prediction of ratings. The results showed a significant difference in the prediction of ratings in the context that was detected as relevant by our method, and the one that was detected as irrelevant, pointing to the importance of the power analysis and the benefits of the proposed method in the case of a small dataset."

    "abstract": "Evaluating algorithmic recommendations is an important, but difficult, problem. Evaluations conducted offline using data collected from user interactions with an online system often suffer from biases arising from the user interface or the recommendation engine. Online evaluation (A/B testing) can more easily address problems of bias, but depending on setting can be time-consuming and incur risk of negatively impacting the user experience, not to mention that it is generally more difficult when access to a large user base is not taken as granted. A compromise based on \\em counterfactual analysis is to present some subset of online users with recommendation results that have been randomized or otherwise manipulated, log their interactions, and then use those to de-bias offline evaluations on historical data. However, previous work does not offer clear conclusions on how well such methods correlate with and are able to predict the results of online A/B tests. Understanding this is crucial to widespread adoption of new offline evaluation techniques in recommender systems. In this work we present a comparison of offline and online evaluation results for a particular recommendation problem: recommending playlists of tracks to a user looking for music. We describe two different ways to think about de-biasing offline collections for more accurate evaluation. Our results show that, contrary to much of the previous work on this topic, properly-conducted offline experiments do correlate well to A/B test results, and moreover that we can expect an offline evaluation to identify the best candidate systems for online testing with high probability."

We found that algorithmic collaborative filtering outperformed humans on average, though some individuals outperformed the system substantially and humans on average outperformed the system on certain prediction tasks."

    "title": "Tansley Review No. 95<sup>15</sup>N natural abundance in soil\u2010plant systems",
    "abstract": "summary Equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations during incomplete reactions result in minute differences in the ratio between the two stable X isotopes, 15 N and 14 N, in various N pools. In ecosystems such variations (usually expressed in per mil [\u03b4 15 N] deviations from the standard atmospheric N 2 ) depend on isotopic signatures of inputs and outputs, the input\u2010output balance, N transformations and their specific isotope effects, and compartmentation of N within the system. Products along a sequence of reactions, e.g. the N mineralization\u2010N uptake pathway, should, if fractionation factors were equal for the different reactions, become progressively depleted. However, fractionation factors van. For example, because nitrification discriminates against 15 N in the substrate more than does N mineralization, NH 4 + can become isotopically heavier than the organic N from which it is derived. Levels of isotopic enrichment depend dynamically on the stoichiometry of reactions, as well as on specific abiotic and biotic conditions. Thus, the \u03b4 15 N of a specific N pool is not a constant, and 15 N of a N compound added to the system is not a conservative, unchanging tracer. This fact, together with analytical problems of measuring 15 N in small and dynamic pools of N in the soil\u2010plant system, and the complexity of the X cycle itself (for instance the abundance of reversible reactions), limit the possibilities of making inferences based on observations of 15 N abundance in one or a few pools of N in a system. Nevertheless, measurements of \u03b4 15 N might offer the advantage of giving insights into the N cycle without disturbing the system by adding 15 N tracer. Such attempts require, however, that the complex factors affecting 15 N in plants be taken into account, viz. (i) the source(s) of N (soil, precipitation, NO X , NH 3 , N 2 \u2010fixation), (ii) the depth(s) in soil from which N is taken up, (iii) the form(s) of soil\u2010N used (organic N, NH 4 + , NO 3 \u2212 ), (iv) influences of mycorrhizal symbioses and fractionations during and after N uptake by plants, and (v) interactions between these factors and plant phenology. Because of this complexity, data on \u03b4 15 N can only be used alone when certain requirements are met, e.g. when a clearly discrete N source in terms of amount and isotopic signature is studied. For example, it is recommended that N in non\u2010N 2 \u2010fixing species should differ more than 5% from N derived by N 2 \u2010fixation, and that several non\u2010N 2 \u2010fixing references are used, when data on \u03b4 15 N are used to estimate N a \u2010fixation in poorly described ecosystems. As well as giving information on N source effects, \u03b4 15 N can give insights into N cycle rates. For example, high levels of N deposition onto previously N\u2010limited systems leads to increased nitrification, which produces 15 N\u2010enriched NH 4 and N\u2010depleted NO 3 . As many forest plants prefer NH 4 \u2212 they become enriched in 15 N in such circumstances. This change in plant 15 N will subsequently also occur in the soil surface horizon after litter\u2010fall, and might be a useful indicator of N saturation, especially since there is usually an increase in 15 N with depth in soils of N\u2010limited forests. Generally, interpretation of 15 N measurements requires additional independent data and modelling, and benefits from a controlled experimental setting. Modelling will be greatly assisted by the development of methods to measure the 15 N of small dynamic pools of N in soils. Direct comparisons with parallel low tracer level 15 N studies will be necessary to further develop the interpretation of variations in 15 N in soil\u2010plant systems. Another promising approach is to study ratios of 15 N: 14 N together with other pairs of stable isotopes, e.g. 13 C: 12 C or 18 O: 16 O, in the same ion or molecules. This approach can help to tackle the challenge of distinguishing isotopic source effects from fractionations within the system studied. CONTENTS Summary 179 I. Introduction 180 II.

Recently pre-trained models have shown their effectiveness in knowledge transfer between domains and tasks, which can potentially alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommender systems. In this survey, we first provide a review of recommender systems with pre-training. In addition, we show the benefits of pre-training to recommender systems through experiments.

In Improving Schooling for Language-Minority Children, a committee of experts focuses on this central question, striving toward the construction of a strong and credible knowledge base to inform the activities of those who educate children as well as those who fund and conduct research. The book reviews a broad range of studies--from basic ones on language, literacy, and learning to others in educational settings. The committee proposes a research agenda that responds to issues of policy and practice yet maintains scientific integrity. This comprehensive volume provides perspective on the history of bilingual education in the United States; summarizes relevant research on development of a second language, literacy, and content knowledge; reviews past evaluation studies; explores what we know about effective schools and classrooms for these children; examines research on the education of teachers of culturally and linguistically diverse students; critically reviews the system for the collection of education statistics as it relates to this student population; and recommends changes in the infrastructure that supports research on these students."

    "abstract": "Information technology executives strive to align the actions of end users with the desired security posture of management and of the firm through persuasive communication. In many cases, some element of fear is incorporated within these communications. However, within the context of computer security and information assurance, it is not yet clear how these fear-inducing arguments, known as fear appeals, will ultimately impact the actions of end users. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of fear appeals on the compliance of end users with recommendations to enact specific individual computer security actions toward the mitigation of threats. An examination was performed that culminated in the development and testing of a conceptual model representing an infusion of technology adoption and fear appeal theories.\r\n\r\nResults of the study suggest that fear appeals do impact end user behavioral intentions to comply with recommended individual acts of security, but the impact is not uniform across all end users. It is determined in part by perceptions of self-efficacy, response efficacy, threat severity, and social influence. The findings of this research contribute to information systems security research, human-computer interaction, and organizational communication by revealing a new paradigm in which IT users form perceptions of the technology, not on the basis of performance gains, but on the basis of utility for threat mitigation."

As such system s must crucially rely on an accurate and complete model of user preferences, the acquisition of this model becomes the central subject of this article. Many tools used today do not satisfactorily assist users to establish this model because they do not adequately focus on fundamental decision objectives, help them reveal hidden preferences, revise conflicting preferences, or explicitly reason about trade\u2010offs. As a result, users fail to find the outcomes that best satisfy their needs and preferences. In this article, we provide some analyses of common areas of design pitfalls and derive a set of design guidelines that assist the user in avoiding these problems in three important areas: user preference elicitation, preference revision, and explanation interfaces. For each area, we describe the state of the art of the developed techniques and discuss concrete scenarios where they have been applied and tested."

    "abstract": "Anthelmintic resistance involving particularly the gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants is escalating globally, to the extent that in certain countries, such as South Africa, it has already reached alarming proportions, and is affecting practically all the anthelmintics. In this paper it is argued that the high levels of resistance in nematodes of veterinary importance indicate that the drugs have been used incorrectly. It is suggested that the phenomenon of refugia plays a much more important role in the selection of anthelmintic resistance than other phenomena that are more frequently investigated and recommended for counteracting it, such as reduced drenching frequency and avoiding under-dosing. While refugia is commonly mentioned in passing in most papers on anthelmintic resistance, it is, almost without exception, not incorporated in the final control/ management proposals. On the strength of the conclusions arrived at in the present paper strategies such as the drench-and-move system in which all the animals in a flock are drenched before they are moved to pastures containing few or no worms in refugia, and the system of strategic drenching on safe pastures should be condemned and never recommended. If such strategies are indeed unavoidable, the farmer should be warned that the farming system would probably not be sustainable even in the short term, in view of the generally high levels of resistance already present in most of the important sheep-producing regions. Farmers should be educated to consider refugia above all else when designing worm management programmes. Finally there seems to be too much complacency concerning the possibility that anthelmintic resistance may also escalate in cattle, eventually to reach the proportions that it has in sheep."

    "title": "Collaborative filtering via euclidean embedding",
    "abstract": "Recommendation systems suggest items based on user preferences. Collaborative filtering is a popular approach in which recommending is based on the rating history of the system. One of the most accurate and scalable collaborative filtering algorithms is matrix factorization, which is based on a latent factor model. We propose a novel Euclidean embedding method as an alternative latent factor model to implement collaborative filtering. In this method, users and items are embedded in a unified Euclidean space where the distance between a user and an item is inversely proportional to the rating. This model is comparable to matrix factorization in terms of both scalability and accuracy while providing several advantages. First, the result of Euclidean embedding is more intuitively understandable for humans, allowing useful visualizations. Second, the neighborhood structure of the unified Euclidean space allows very efficient recommendation queries. Finally, the method facilitates online implementation requirements such as mapping new users or items in an existing model. Our experimental results confirm these advantages and show that collaborative filtering via Euclidean embedding is a promising approach for online recommender systems."

    "title": "Creating a Recommender System to Support Higher Education Students in the Subject Enrollment Decision",
    "abstract": "Higher Education plays a principal role in the changing and complex world of today, and there has been rapid growth in the scientific literature dedicated to predicting students' academic success or risk of dropout thanks to advances in Data Mining techniques. Degrees such as Computer Science in particular are in ever greater demand. Although the number of students has increased, the number graduating is still not enough to provide society with as many as it requires. This study contributes to reversing this situation by introducing an approach that not only predicts the dropout risk or students' performance but takes action to help both students and educational institutions. The focus is on maximizing graduation rates by constructing a Recommender System to assist students with their selection of subjects. In particular, the challenge is addressed of constructing reliable Recommender Systems on the basis of data which are both sparse and few in quantity, imbalanced, and anonymized, and which might have been stored under imperfect conditions. This approach is successfully applied to create a Recommender System using a real-world dataset from a public Spanish university containing performance data of a Computer Science degree course, demonstrating its successful application in real environments. The construction of a support system based on that approach is described, its results are evaluated, and its implications for students' academic achievement, and for institutions' graduation rates are discussed. Through the construction of this decision support system for students, we intend to increase the graduation rates and lower the dropout rate."

    "abstract": "Nowadays there is a widespread diffusion of mobile applications for weight and diet management. Even though, the most popular apps are not usually experimented in clinical contexts, as well as apps are not supported by medical evidence. Further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness of apps for weight and diet management. Moreover, there are few examples of food recommender systems that provide to the users nutritional facts about suitable food choices and take into account individual physiological status and environmental situations. We propose DIETOS (DIET Organizer System), a recommender system for the adaptive delivery of nutrition contents to improve the quality of life of both healthy people and individuals affected by chronic diet-related diseases. The proposed system is able to build a user's health profile, and provides individualized nutritional recommendation according to the health profile. The profile is created through the use of dynamic real-time questionnaires prepared by medical doctors and compiled by the users. The health profile includes information about health status and eventual chronic diseases. The first prototype of the system (available online at http://www.easyanalysis.it/dietos), includes a catalogue of typical Calabrian foods compiled by nutrition specialists (Calabria is a region of the southern Italy). DIETOS can suggest not only the use of specific foods compatible with the health status, but also it may give dietary indications related to some specific pathologies or health conditions."

    "title": "Ending the Reading Wars: Reading Acquisition From Novice to Expert",
    "abstract": "There is intense public interest in questions surrounding how children learn to read and how they can best be taught. Research in psychological science has provided answers to many of these questions but, somewhat surprisingly, this research has been slow to make inroads into educational policy and practice. Instead, the field has been plagued by decades of \"reading wars.\" Even now, there remains a wide gap between the state of research knowledge about learning to read and the state of public understanding. The aim of this article is to fill this gap. We present a comprehensive tutorial review of the science of learning to read, spanning from children's earliest alphabetic skills through to the fluent word recognition and skilled text comprehension characteristic of expert readers. We explain why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English. But we also move beyond phonics, reviewing research on what else children need to learn to become expert readers and considering how this might be translated into effective classroom practice. We call for an end to the reading wars and recommend an agenda for instruction and research in reading acquisition that is balanced, developmentally informed, and based on a deep understanding of how language and writing systems work."

    "title": "Investigating gender fairness of recommendation algorithms in the music domain",
    "abstract": "Although recommender systems (RSs) play a crucial role in our society, previous studies have revealed that the performance of RSs may considerably differ between groups of individuals with different characteristics or from different demographics. In this case, a RS is considered to be unfair when it does not perform equally well for different groups of users. Considering the importance of RSs in the distribution and consumption of musical content worldwide, a careful evaluation of fairness in the context of music RSs is crucial. To this end, we first introduce LFM-2b, a novel large-scale real-world dataset of music listening records, comprising a subset to investigate bias of RSs regarding users' demographics. We then define a notion of fairness based on the performance gap of a RS between the users with different demographics, and evaluate a variety of collaborative filtering algorithms in terms of accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics to explore the fairness in the RS results toward a specific gender group. We observe the existence of significant discrepancies (unfairness) between the performance of algorithms across male and female user groups. Based on these discrepancies, we explore to what extent recommender algorithms lead to intensifying the underlying population bias in the final results. We also study the effect of a resampling strategy, commonly used as debiasing method , which yields slight improvements in the fairness measures of various algorithms while maintaining their accuracy and beyond-accuracy performance."

    "title": "Can a Recommender System Induce Serendipitous Encounters?",
    "abstract": "Today recommenders are commonly used with various purposes, especially dealing with ecommerce and information filtering tools. Content-based recommenders rely on the concept of similarity between the bought/searched/visited item and all the items stored in a repository. It is a common belief that the user is interested in what is similar to what she has already bought/searched/visited. We believe that there are some contexts in which this assumption is wrong: it is the case of acquiring unsearched but still useful items or pieces of information. This is called serendipity. Our purpose is to stimulate users and facilitate these serendipitous encounters to happen. This chapter presents the design and implementation of a hybrid recommender system that joins a content-based approach and serendipitous heuristics in order to mitigate the overspecialization problem with surprising suggestions. The chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 presents background and motivation; Section 3 introduces the serendipity issue for information seeking; Section 4 covers strategies to provide serendipitous recommendations; Section 5 provides a description of our recommender system and how it discovers potentially serendipitous items in addition to content-based suggested ones; Section 6 provides the description of the experimental session carried out to evaluate the proposed ideas; finally, Section 7 draws conclusions and provides directions for future work."

    "title": "Calibration Estimators in Survey Sampling",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates estimation of finite population totals in the presence of univariate or multivariate auxiliary information. Estimation is equivalent to attaching weights to the survey data. We focus attention on the several weighting systems that can be associated with a given amount of auxiliary information and derive a weighting system with the aid of a distance measure and a set of calibration equations. We briefly mention an application to the case in which the information consists of known marginal counts in a two- or multi-way table, known as generalized raking. The general regression estimator (GREG) was conceived with multivariate auxiliary information in mind. Ordinarily, this estimator is justified by a regression relationship between the study variable y and the auxiliary vector x. But we note that the GREG can be derived by a different route by focusing instead on the weights. The ordinary sampling weights of the kth observation is 1/\u03c0k , where \u03c0k is the inclusion probability of k. We show that the weights implied by the GREG are as close as possible, according to a given distance measure, to the 1/\u03c0k while respecting side conditions called calibration equations. These state that the sample sum of the weighted auxiliary variable values must equal the known population total for that auxiliary variable. That is, the calibrated weights must give perfect estimates when applied to each auxiliary variable. That is a consistency check that appeals to many practitioners, because a strong correlation between the auxiliary variables and the study variable means that the weights that perform well for the auxiliary variable also should perform well for the study variable. The GREG uses the auxiliary information efficiently, so the estimates are precise; however, the individual weights are not always without reproach. For example, negative weights can occur, and in some applications this does not make sense. It is natural to seek the root of the dissatisfaction in the underlying distance measure. Consequently, we allow alternative distance measures that satisfy only a set of minimal requirements. Each distance measure leads, via the calibration equations, to a specific weighting system and thereby to a new estimator. These estimators form a family of calibration estimators. We show that the GREG is a first approximation to all other members of the family; all are asymptotically equivalent to the GREG, and the variance estimator already known for the GREG is recommended for use in any other member of the family. Numerical features of the weights and ease of computation become more than anything else the bases for choosing between the estimators. The reasoning is applied to calibration on known marginals of a two-way frequency table. Our family of distance measures leads in this case to a family of generalized raking procedures, of which classical raking ratio is one."

Unfortunately, current recommender systems suffer from various privacy-protection vulnerabilities. We report on the first experimental realization of a theoretical framework called ALAMBIC, which we had previously put forth to protect the privacy of customers and the commercial interests of merchants. Our system is a hybrid recommender that combines content-based, demographic and collaborative filtering techniques. The originality of our approach is to split customer data between the merchant and a semi-trusted third party, so that neither can derive sensitive information from their share alone. Therefore, the system can only be subverted by a coalition between these two parties. Experimental results confirm that the performance and user-friendliness of the application need not suffer from the adoption of such privacy-protection solutions. Furthermore, user testing of our prototype show that users react positively to the privacy model proposed."

To support recommendation in social activities, group recommender systems were developed. Group recommender systems usually consider predened/a priori known groups and just a few existing approaches are able to automatically identify groups. When groups are not already formed, another key aspect of group recommendation is related to groups identication. In this paper a novel algorithm able to identify groups of users and produce recommendations for each group is presented. The algorithm uses individual recommendations and a classic clustering algorithm to identify and model groups. Experimental results show how this approach substantially improves the quality of group recommendations with respect to the state-of-the-art."

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most popular recommendation model. Specifically, Graph Neural Network (GNN) has become a new state-of-the-art for CF. In the GNN-based recommender system, message dropout is usually used to alleviate the selection bias in the user-item bipartite graph. However, message dropout might deteriorate the recommender system's performance due to the randomness of dropping out the outgoing messages based on the user-item bipartite graph. To solve this problem, we propose a graph contrastive learning module for a general recommender system that learns the embeddings in a self-supervised manner and reduces the randomness of message dropout. Besides, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) based on a negative sampling strategy. However, BPR has the following problems: suboptimal sampling and sample bias. We introduce a new debiased contrastive loss to solve these problems, which provides sufficient negative samples and applies a bias correction probability to alleviate the sample bias. We integrate the proposed framework, including graph contrastive module and debiased contrastive module with several Matrix Factorization(MF) and GNN-based recommendation models. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

    "title": "Personalised Reranking of Paper Recommendations Using Paper Content and User Behavior",
    "abstract": "Academic search engines have been widely used to access academic papers, where users\u2019 information needs are explicitly represented as search queries. Some modern recommender systems have taken one step further by predicting users\u2019 information needs without the presence of an explicit query. In this article, we examine an academic paper recommender that sends out paper recommendations in email newsletters, based on the users\u2019 browsing history on the academic search engine. Specifically, we look at users who regularly browse papers on the search engine, and we sign up for the recommendation newsletters for the first time. We address the task of reranking the recommendation candidates that are generated by a production system for such users. We face the challenge that the users on whom we focus have not interacted with the recommender system before, which is a common scenario that every recommender system encounters when new users sign up. We propose an approach to reranking candidate recommendations that utilizes both paper content and user behavior. The approach is designed to suit the characteristics unique to our academic recommendation setting. For instance, content similarity measures can be used to find the closest match between candidate recommendations and the papers previously browsed by the user. To this end, we use a knowledge graph derived from paper metadata to compare entity similarities (papers, authors, and journals) in the embedding space. Since the users on whom we focus have no prior interactions with the recommender system, we propose a model to learn a mapping from users\u2019 browsed articles to user clicks on the recommendations. We combine both content and behavior into a hybrid reranking model that outperforms the production baseline significantly, providing a relative 13% increase in Mean Average Precision and 28% in Precision@1. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the model components, highlighting where the performance boost comes from. The obtained insights reveal useful components for the reranking process and can be generalized to other academic recommendation settings as well, such as the utility of graph embedding similarity. Also, recent papers browsed by users provide stronger evidence for recommendation than historical ones."

    "abstract": "Educational recommender systems channel most of the research efforts on the effectiveness of the recommended items. While teachers have a central role in online platforms, the impact of recommender systems for teachers in terms of the exposure such systems give to the courses is an under-explored area. In this paper, we consider data coming from a real-world platform and analyze the distribution of the recommendations w.r.t. the geographical provenience of the teachers. We observe that data is highly imbalanced towards the United States, in terms of offered courses and of interactions. These imbalances are exacerbated by recommender systems, which overexpose the country w.r.t. its representation in the data, thus generating unfairness for teachers outside that country. To introduce equity, we propose an approach that regulates the share of recommendations given to the items produced in a country (visibility) and the position of the items in the recommended list (exposure)."

    "title": "Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown as promising solutions for collaborative filtering (CF) with the modeling of user-item interaction graphs. The key idea of existing GNN-based recommender systems is to recursively perform the message passing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded embeddings. Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation studies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation framework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues.

    "title": "Learning Compatibility Across Categories for Heterogeneous Item Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Identifying relationships between items is a key task of an online recommender system, in order to help users discover items that are functionally complementary or visually compatible. In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of \"compatibility\" to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible-whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger-they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others. In this paper we propose a novel method, Monomer, to learn complicated and heterogeneous relationships between items in product recommendation settings. Recently, scalable methods have been developed that address this task by learning similarity metrics on top of the content of the products involved. Here our method relaxes the metricity assumption inherent in previous work and models multiple localized notions of 'relatedness,' so as to uncover ways in which related items should be systematically similar, and systematically different. Quantitatively, we show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale compatibility prediction tasks, especially in cases where there is substantial heterogeneity between related items."

    "title": "Detection of shilling attacks in collaborative filtering recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering recommender systems are essentially information systems which are capable of combining the judgment of a large group of people to make personalized recommendations and thereby alleviate the so-called information overload problem. However,collaborative filtering recommender systems are generally vulnerable to shilling attacks. Attackers can inject carefully chosen profiles into recommender systems in order to bias the recommendation results to their benefits. This may lead to a significant negative impact on the robustness of the systems. The main contribution of this paper is to build a probabilistic model for attack detection in the framework of probabilistic generative model. Experimental results show that this model can effectively detect shilling attacks of typical types."

    "title": "SIREN",
    "abstract": "The growing volume of digital data stimulates the adoption of recommender systems in different socioeconomic domains, including news industries. While news recommenders help consumers deal with information overload and increase their engagement, their use also raises an increasing number of societal concerns, such as \"Matthew effects\", \"filter bubbles\", and the overall lack of transparency. We argue that focusing on transparency for content-providers is an under-explored avenue. As such, we designed a simulation framework called SIREN1 (SImulating Recommender Effects in online News environments), that allows content providers to (i) select and parameterize different recommenders and (ii) analyze and visualize their effects with respect to two diversity metrics. Taking the U.S. news media as a case study, we present an analysis on the recommender effects with respect to long-tail novelty and unexpectedness using SIREN. Our analysis offers a number of interesting findings, such as the similar potential of certain algorithmically simple (item-based k-Nearest Neighbour) and sophisticated strategies (based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking) to increase diversity over time. Overall, we argue that simulating the effects of recommender systems can help content providers to make more informed decisions when choosing algorithmic recommenders, and as such can help mitigate the aforementioned societal concerns."

    "title": "Optimal pricing with recommender systems",
    "abstract": "We study optimal pricing in the presence of recommender systems. A recommender system affects the market in two ways: (i) it creates value by reducing product uncertainty for the customers and hence (ii) its recommendations can be offered as add-ons which generate informational externalities. The quality of the recommendation add-on is endogenously determined by sales. We investigate the impact of these factors on the optimal pricing by a seller with a recommender system against a competitive fringe without such a system. If the recommender system is sufficiently effective in reducing uncertainty, then the seller prices otherwise symmetric products differently to have some products experienced more aggressively. Moreover, the seller segments the market so that customers with more in.exible tastes pay higher prices to get better recommendation."

    "title": "Towards Better Representation Learning for Personalized News Recommendation: a Multi-Channel Deep Fusion Approach",
    "abstract": "Millions of news articles emerge every day. How to provide personalized news recommendations has become a critical task for service providers. In the past few decades, latent factor models has been widely used for building recommender systems (RSs). With the remarkable success of deep learning techniques especially in visual computing and natural language understanding, more and more researchers have been trying to leverage deep neural networks to learn latent representations for advanced RSs. Following mainstream deep learning-based RSs, we propose a novel deep fusion model (DFM), which aims to improve the representation learning abilities in deep RSs and can be used for both candidate retrieval and item re-ranking. There are two key components in our DFM approach, namely an inception module and an attention mechanism. The inception module improves the plain multi-layer network via leveraging of various levels of interaction simultaneously, while the attention mechanism merges latent representations learnt from different channels in a customized fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on a commercial news reading dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed DFM is superior to several state-of-the-art models."

    "title": "Implementation of a Product-Recommender System in an IoT-Based Smart Shopping Using Fuzzy Logic and Apriori Algorithm",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently become important in accelerating various functions, from manufacturing and business to healthcare and retail. A recommender system can handle the problem of information and data buildup in IoT-based smart commerce systems. These technologies are designed to determine users' preferences and filter out irrelevant information. Identifying items and services that customers might be interested in and then convincing them to buy is one of the essential parts of effective IoT-based smart shopping systems. Due to the relevance of product-recommender systems from both the consumer and shop perspectives, this article presents a new IoT-based smart product-recommender system based on an apriori algorithm and fuzzy logic. The suggested technique employs association rules to display the interdependencies and linkages among many data objects. The most common use of association rule discovery is \"shopping cart analysis.\" Customers' buying habits and behavior are studied based on the numerous goods they place in their shopping carts. As a result, the association rules are generated using a fuzzy system. The apriori algorithm then selects the product based on the provided fuzzy association rules. The results revealed that the suggested technique had achieved acceptable results in terms of mean absolute error, root-mean-square error, precision, recall, diversity, novelty, and catalog coverage when compared to cutting-edge methods. Finally, the method helps increase recommender systems' diversity in IoT-based smart shopping."

Selecting the appropriate metric is a critical and ranking accuracy usually attracts the most attention nowadays. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the advantages of different ranking metrics which were previously used in Information Retrieval and are now used for assessing top-N recommenders. We propose methodologies for comparing the robustness and the discriminative power of different metrics. On the one hand, we study cut-offs and we find that deeper cut-offs offer greater robustness and discriminative power. On the other hand, we find that precision offers high robustness and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain provides the best discriminative power."

    "title": "Learning and Transferring Social and Item Visibilities for Personalized Recommendation",
    "abstract": "User feedback in the form of movie-watching history, item ratings, or product consumption is very helpful in training recommender systems. However, relatively few interactions between items and users can be observed. Instances of missing user--item entries are caused by the user not seeing the item (although the actual preference to the item could still be positive) or the user seeing the item but not liking it. Separating these two cases enables missing interactions to be modeled with finer granularity, and thus reflects user preferences more accurately. However, most previous studies on the modeling of missing instances have not fully considered the case where the user has not seen the item. Social connections are known to be helpful for modeling users' potential preferences more extensively, although a similar visibility problem exists in accurately identifying social relationships. That is, when two users are unaware of each other's existence, they have no opportunity to connect. In this paper, we propose a novel user preference model for recommender systems that considers the visibility of both items and social relationships. Furthermore, the two kinds of information are coordinated in a unified model inspired by the idea of transfer learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world datasets in comparison with five state-of-the-art approaches. The encouraging performance of the proposed system verifies the effectiveness of social knowledge transfer and the modeling of both item and social visibilities."

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing prosperity of web Application Programming Interface (API) sharing platforms, it is becoming an economic and efficient way for software developers to design their interested mashups through web API re-use. Generally, a software developer can browse, evaluate, and select his or her preferred web APIs from the API's sharing platforms to create various mashups with rich functionality. The big volume of candidate APIs places a heavy burden on software developers\u2019 API selection decisions. This, in turn, calls for the support of intelligent API recommender systems. However, existing API recommender systems often face two challenges. First, they focus more on the functional accuracy of APIs while neglecting the APIs\u2019 actual compatibility. This then creates incompatible mashups. Second, they often require software developers to input a set of keywords that can accurately describe the expected functions of the mashup to be developed. This second challenge tests partial developers who have little background knowledge in the fields. To tackle the above-mentioned challenges, in this article we propose a compatibility-aware and text description-driven web API recommendation approach (named WAR text ). WAR text guarantees the compatibility among the recommended APIs by utilizing the APIs\u2019 composition records produced by historical mashup creations. Besides, WAR text entitles a software developer to type a simple text document that describes the expected mashup functions as input. Then through textual description mining, WAR text can precisely capture the developers\u2019 functional requirements and then return a set of APIs with the highest compatibility. Finally, through a real-world mashup dataset ProgrammableWeb, we validate the feasibility of our novel approach."

Specifically, we first extend BGEM to model group-item interactions, and then in order to overcome the sparsity of the interaction data generated by occasional groups, we propose a self-attentive mechanism to represent groups based on the group members. To further alleviate the group data sparsity problem, we propose two model optimization approaches to exploit an and integrate the user-item interaction data. To overcome the sparsity issue of user-item interaction data, we extend GCNs to leverage the social network to enhance user representation learning. We create two large-scale benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed CAGR."

We consider a scenario, where given an initial user query, the recommender system may ask the user to provide additional features describing the searched products. The objective is to generate questions/features that a user would likely reply, and if replied, would effectively reduce the result size of the initial query. Classical entropy-based feature selection methods are effective in term of result size reduction, but they select questions uncorrelated with user needs and therefore unlikely to be replied. We propose two feature-selection methods that combine feature entropy with an appropriate measure of feature relevance. We evaluated these methods in a set of simulated interactions where a probabilistic model of user behavior is exploited. The results show that these methods outperform entropy-based feature selection."

Inspired by fast and accurate matrix factorization techniques for collaborative filtering, we develop a real-time algorithm for estimating the hand pose from RGB-D data of a commercial depth camera. First, we efficiently identify nearest neighbors using local shape descriptors in the RGB-D domain from a library of hand poses with known pose parameter values. We then use this information to evaluate the unknown pose parameters using a joint matrix factorization and completion (JMFC) approach. Our quantitative and qualitative results suggest that our approach is robust to variation in hand configurations while achieving real time performance (\u2248 29 FPS) on a standard computer."

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems (RSs) help users search large amounts of digital contents and services by allowing them to identify the items that are likely to be more attractive or useful. RSs play an important persuasion role, as they can potentially augment the users\u2019 trust towards in an application and orient their decisions or actions towards specific directions. This article explores the persuasiveness of RSs, presenting two vast empirical studies that address a number of research questions. First, we investigate if a design property of RSs, defined by the statistically measured quality of algorithms, is a reliable predictor of their potential for persuasion. This factor is measured in terms of perceived quality, defined by the overall satisfaction, as well as by how users judge the accuracy and novelty of recommendations. For our purposes, we designed an empirical study involving 210 subjects and implemented seven full-sized versions of a commercial RS, each one using the same interface and dataset (a subset of Netflix), but each with a different recommender algorithm. In each experimental configuration we computed the statistical quality (recall and F-measures) and collected data regarding the quality perceived by 30 users. The results show us that algorithmic attributes are less crucial than we might expect in determining the user\u2019s perception of an RS\u2019s quality, and suggest that the user\u2019s judgment and attitude towards a recommender are likely to be more affected by factors related to the user experience. Second, we explore the persuasiveness of RSs in the context of large interactive TV services. We report a study aimed at assessing whether measurable persuasion effects (e.g., changes of shopping behavior) can be achieved through the introduction of a recommender. Our data, collected for more than one year, allow us to conclude that, (1) the adoption of an RS can affect both the lift factor and the conversion rate, determining an increased volume of sales and influencing the user\u2019s decision to actually buy one of the recommended products, (2) the introduction of an RS tends to diversify purchases and orient users towards less obvious choices (the long tail), and (3) the perceived novelty of recommendations is likely to be more influential than their perceived accuracy. Overall, the results of these studies improve our understanding of the persuasion phenomena induced by RSs, and have implications that can be of interest to academic scholars, designers, and adopters of this class of systems."

    "abstract": "Classic recommender systems face challenges in addressing the data sparsity and cold-start problems with only modeling the user-item relation. An essential direction is to incorporate and understand the additional heterogeneous relations, e.g., user-user and item-item relations, since each user-item interaction is often influenced by other users and items, which form the user\u2019s/item\u2019s influential contexts. This induces important yet challenging issues, including modeling heterogeneous relations, interactions, and the strength of the influence from users/items in the influential contexts. To this end, we design Influential-Context Aggregation Units (ICAU) to aggregate the user-user/item-item relations within a given context as the influential context embeddings. Accordingly, we propose a Heterogeneous relations-Embedded Recommender System (HERS) based on ICAUs to model and interpret the underlying motivation of user-item interactions by considering user-user and item-item influences. The experiments on two real-world datasets show the highly improved recommendation quality made by HERS and its superiority in handling the cold-start problem. In addition, we demonstrate the interpretability of modeling influential contexts in explaining the recommendation results."

We aim in this systematic review to provide insight into the published literature concerning the quality of health information and educational videos found on YouTube.We searched Google Scholar, Medline (through PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, Direct Science, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases to find all papers on the analysis of medical and health-related content published in English up to August 2020. Based on eligibility criteria, 202 papers were included in our study. We reviewed every article and extracted relevant data such as the number of videos and assessors, the number and type of quality categories, and the recommendations made by the authors. The extracted data from the papers were aggregated using different methods to compile the results.The total number of videos assessed in the selected articles is 22,300 (median = 94, interquartile range = 50.5-133). The videos were evaluated by one or multiple assessors (median = 2, interquartile range = 1-3). The video quality was assessed by scoring, categorization, or based on creators' bias. Researchers commonly employed scoring systems that are either standardized (e.g., GQS, DISCERN, and JAMA) or based upon the guidelines and recommendations of professional associations. Results from the aggregation of scoring or categorization data indicate that health-related content on YouTube is of average to below-average quality. The compiled results from bias-based classification show that only 32% of the videos appear neutral toward the health content. Furthermore, the majority of the studies confirmed either negative or no correlation between the quality and popularity of the assessed videos.YouTube is not a reliable source of medical and health-related information. YouTube's popularity-driven metrics such as the number of views and likes should not be considered quality indicators. YouTube should improve its ranking and recommender system to promote higher-quality content. One way is to consider expert reviews of medical and health-related videos and to include their assessment data in the ranking algorithm."

    "title": "International standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury (Revised 2011)",
    "abstract": "This article represents the content of the booklet, International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, revised 2011, published by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). For further explanation of the clarifications and changes in this revision, see the accompanying article (Kirshblum S., et al. J Spinal Cord Med. 2011:doi 10.1179/107902611X13186000420242\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord is the major conduit through which motor and sensory information travels between the brain and body. The spinal cord contains longitudinally oriented spinal tracts (white matter) surrounding central areas (gray matter) where most spinal neuronal cell bodies are located. The gray matter is organized into segments comprising sensory and motor neurons. Axons from spinal sensory neurons enter and axons from motor neurons leave the spinal cord via segmental nerves or roots.\r\n\r\nIn the cervical spine, there are 8 nerve roots. Cervical roots of C1-C7 are named according to the vertebra above which they exit (i.e. C1 exits above the C1 vertebra, just below the skull and C6 nerve roots pass between the C5 and C6 vertebrae) whereas C8 exists between the C7 and T1 vertebra; as there is no C8 vertebra. The C1 nerve root does not have a sensory component that is tested on the International Standards Examination.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic spine has 12 distinct nerve roots and the lumbar spine consists of 5 distinct nerve roots that are each named accordingly as they exit below the level of the respective vertebrae. The sacrum consists of 5 embryonic sections that have fused into one bony structure with 5 distinct nerve roots that exit via the sacral foramina. The spinal cord itself ends at approximately the L1-2 vertebral level. The distal most part of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The cauda equina is a cluster of paired (right and left) lumbosacral nerve roots that originate in the region of the conus medullaris and travel down through the thecal sac and exit via the intervertebral foramen below their respective vertebral levels. There may be 0, 1, or 2 coccygeal nerves but they do not have a role with the International Standards examination in accordance with the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI).\r\n\r\nEach root receives sensory information from skin areas called dermatomes. Similarly each root innervates a group of muscles called a myotome. While a dermatome usually represents a discrete and contiguous skin area, most roots innervate more than one muscle, and most muscles are innervated by more than one root.\r\n\r\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) affects conduction of sensory and motor signals across the site(s) of lesion(s), as well as the autonomic nervous system. By systematically examining the dermatomes and myotomes, as described within this booklet, one can determine the cord segments affected by the SCI. From the International Standards examination several measures of neurological damage are generated, e.g., Sensory and Motor Levels (on right and left sides), NLI, Sensory Scores (Pin Prick and Light Touch), Motor Scores (upper and lower limb), and ZPP. This booklet also describes the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) Impairment Scale (AIS) to classify the severity (i.e. completeness) of injury.\r\n\r\nThis booklet begins with basic definitions of common terms used herein. The section that follows describes the recommended International Standards examination, including both sensory and motor components. Subsequent sections cover sensory and motor scores, the AIS classification, and clinical syndromes associated with SCI. For ease of reference, a worksheet (Appendix 1) of the recommended examination is included, with a summary of steps used to classify the injury (Appendix 2). A full-size version for photocopying and use in patient records has been included as an enclosure and may also be downloaded from the ASIA website (www.asia-spinalinjury.org). Additional details regarding the examination and e-Learning training materials can also be obtained from the website15."

    "title": "Online QoS Prediction for Runtime Service Adaptation via Adaptive Matrix Factorization",
    "abstract": "Cloud applications built on service-oriented architectures generally integrate a number of component services to fulfill certain application logic. The changing cloud environment highlights the need for these applications to keep resilient against QoS variations of their component services so that end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) can be guaranteed. Runtime service adaptation is a key technique to achieve this goal. To support timely and accurate adaptation decisions, effective and efficient QoS prediction is needed to obtain real-time QoS information of component services. However, current research has focused mostly on QoS prediction of working services that are being used by a cloud application, but little on predicting QoS values of candidate services that are equally important in determining optimal adaptation actions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive matrix factorization (namely AMF) approach to perform online QoS prediction for candidate services. AMF is inspired from the widely-used collaborative filtering techniques in recommender systems, but significantly extends the conventional matrix factorization model with new techniques of data transformation, online learning, and adaptive weights. Comprehensive experiments, as well as a case study, have been conducted based on a real-world QoS dataset of Web services (with over 40 million QoS records). The evaluation results demonstrate AMF's superiority in achieving accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, which are essential to enable optimal runtime service adaptation."

    "title": "The reinforcing influence of recommendations on global diversification",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems are promising ways to filter the overabundant information in modern society. Their algorithms help individuals to explore decent items, but it is unclear how they allocate popularity among items. In this paper, we simulate successive recommendations and measure their influence on the dispersion of item popularity by Gini coefficient. Our result indicates that local diffusion and collaborative filtering reinforce the popularity of hot items, widening the popularity dispersion. On the other hand, the heat conduction algorithm increases the popularity of the niche items and generates smaller dispersion of item popularity. Simulations are compared to mean-field predictions. Our results suggest that recommender systems have reinforcing influence on global diversification."

    "title": "FEXIPRO",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have many successful applications in e-commerce and social media, including Amazon, Netflix, and Yelp. Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of the most popular recommendation approaches; the original user-product rating matrix R with millions of rows and columns is decomposed into a user matrix Q and an item matrix P, such that the product QT P approximates R. Each column q (p) of Q (P) holds the latent factors of the corresponding user (item), and qT p is a prediction of the rating to item p by user q. Recommender systems based on MF suggest to a user in q the items with the top-k scores in qT P. For this problem, we propose a Fast and EXact Inner PROduct retrieval (FEXIPRO) framework, based on sequential scan, which includes three elements. First, FEXIPRO applies an SVD transformation to P, after which the first several dimensions capture a large percentage of the inner products. This enables us to prune item vectors by only computing their partial inner products with q. Second, we construct an integer approximation version of P, which can be used to compute fast upper bounds for the inner products that can prune item vectors. Finally, we apply a lossless transformation to P, such that the resulting matrix has only positive values, allowing for the inner products to be monotonically increasing with dimensionality. Experiments on real data demonstrate that our framework outperforms alternative approaches typically by an order of magnitude."

    "title": "Context-aware citation recommendation",
    "abstract": "When you write papers, how many times do you want to make some citations at a place but you are not sure which papers to cite? Do you wish to have a recommendation system which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that you want to make some citations? In this paper, we present our initiative of building a context-aware citation recommendation system. High quality citation recommendation is challenging: not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper under composition, but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made. Moreover, it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality. We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX. An extensive empirical evaluation in the CiteSeerX digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach."

Such contextual bandit feedback can be available in huge quantities (e.g., logs of search engines, recommender systems) at little cost, opening up a path for training deep networks on orders of magnitude more data. To this effect, we propose a Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) approach for training deep networks using an equivariant empirical risk estimator with variance regularization, BanditNet, and show how the resulting objective can be decomposed in a way that allows Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by showing how deep networks \u2014 ResNets in particular \u2014 can be trained for object recognition without conventionally labeled images."

If no screening programme is available, repetition of colonoscopy 10 years after the index colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). <b>2 </b>In the high risk group (patients with adenomas with villous histology or high grade dysplasia or \u226510 mm in size, or \u2265 3 adenomas), the ESGE recommends surveillance colonoscopy 3 years after the index colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Patients with 10 or more adenomas should be referred for genetic counselling (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). <b>3</b> In the high risk group, if no high risk adenomas are detected at the first surveillance examination, the ESGE suggests a 5-year interval before a second surveillance colonoscopy (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). If high risk adenomas are detected at first or subsequent surveillance examinations, a 3-year repetition of surveillance colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). <b>4 </b>The ESGE recommends that patients with serrated polyps < 10 mm in size with no dysplasia should be classified as low risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). The ESGE suggests that patients with large serrated polyps (\u2265 10 mm) or those with dysplasia should be classified as high risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). <b>5 </b>The ESGE recommends that the endoscopist is responsible for providing a written recommendation for the post-polypectomy surveillance schedule (strong recommendation, low quality evidence)."

    "abstract": "We investigate whether model extraction can be used to \u2018steal\u2019 the weights of sequential recommender systems, and the potential threats posed to victims of such attacks. This type of risk has attracted attention in image and text classification, but to our knowledge not in recommender systems. We argue that sequential recommender systems are subject to unique vulnerabilities due to the specific autoregressive regimes used to train them. Unlike many existing recommender attackers, which assume the dataset used to train the victim model is exposed to attackers, we consider a data-free setting, where training data are not accessible. Under this setting, we propose an API-based model extraction method via limited-budget synthetic data generation and knowledge distillation. We investigate state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendation and show their vulnerability under model extraction and downstream attacks."

    "title": "Hybrid Recommender Systems based on Content Feature Relationship",
    "abstract": "Recommendation systems get ever-increasing importance due to their applications in both academia and industry. The most popular type of these systems, known as collaborative filtering algorithms, employ user-item interactions to perform the recommendation tasks. With growth of additional information sources other than the rating (or purchase) history of users on items, such as item descriptions and social media information, further extensions of these systems have been proposed, known as hybrid recommendation algorithms. Hybrid recommenders use both user-item interaction data and their contextual information. In this work, we propose new hybrid recommender algorithms by considering the relationship between content features. This relationship is embedded into the hybrid recommenders to improve their accuracy. We first introduce a novel method to extract the content feature relationship matrix, and then the collaborative filtering recommender is modified such that this relationship matrix can be effectively integrated within the algorithm. The proposed algorithm can better deal with the cold-start problem than the state-of-art algorithms. We also propose a novel content-based hybrid recommender system. Our experiments on a benchmark movie dataset show that the proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of the system, while resulting in satisfactory performance in terms of novelty and diversity of the recommendation lists."

We introduce a framework for quantifying the gains attackers realize, taking into account the financial cost of mounting the attack. A cost-benefit analysis of third-party attacks on recommender systems shows that attackers realize profits even when incurring costs associated with rating insertions."

Grade III AC was not indicated for straightforward laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Lap\u2010C). Following analysis of subsequent clinical investigations and drawing on Big Data in particular, TG 18 proposes that some Grade III AC can be treated by Lap\u2010C when performed at advanced centers with specialized surgeons experienced in this procedure and for patients that satisfy certain strict criteria. For Grade I, TG 18 recommends early Lap\u2010C if the patients meet the criteria of Charlson comorbidity index ( CCI ) \u22645 and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification ( ASA \u2010 PS ) \u22642. For Grade II AC , if patients meet the criteria of CCI \u22645 and ASA \u2010 PS \u22642, TG 18 recommends early Lap\u2010C performed by experienced surgeons; and if not, after medical treatment and/or gallbladder drainage, Lap\u2010C would be indicated. TG 18 proposes that Lap\u2010C is indicated in Grade III patients with strict criteria. These are that the patients have favorable organ system failure, and negative predictive factors, who meet the criteria of CCI \u22643 and ASA \u2010 PS \u22642 and who are being treated at an advanced center (where experienced surgeons practice). If the patient is not considered suitable for early surgery, TG 18 recommends early/urgent biliary drainage followed by delayed Lap\u2010C once the patient's overall condition has improved.

    "title": "Transfer learning to predict missing ratings via heterogeneous user feedbacks",
    "abstract": "Data sparsity due to missing ratings is a major challenge for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques in recommender systems. This is especially true for CF domains where the ratings are expressed numerically. We observe that, while we may lack the information in numerical ratings, we may have more data in the form of binary ratings. This is especially true when users can easily express themselves with their likes and dislikes for certain items. In this paper, we explore how to use the binary preference data expressed in the form of like/dislike to help reduce the impact of data sparsity of more expressive numerical ratings. We do this by transferring the rating knowledge from some auxiliary data source in binary form (that is, likes or dislikes), to a target numerical rating matrix. Our solution is to model both numerical ratings and like/dislike in a principled way, using a novel framework of Transfer by Collective Factorization (TCF). In particular, we construct the shared latent space collectively and learn the data-dependent effect separately. A major advantage of the TCF approach over previous collective matrix factorization (or bifactorization) methods is that we are able to capture the data-dependent effect when sharing the data-independent knowledge, so as to increase the over-all quality of knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCF at various sparsity levels as compared to several state-of-the-art methods."

Deep neural networks are used in this area particularly for extracting latent factors of music items from audio signals or metadata and for learning sequential patterns of music items (tracks or artists) from music playlists or listening sessions. Latent item factors are commonly integrated into content-based filtering and hybrid MRS, whereas sequence models of music items are used for sequential music recommendation, e.g., automatic playlist continuation. This review article explains particularities of the music domain in RS research. It gives an overview of the state of the art that employs deep learning for music recommendation. The discussion is structured according to the dimensions of neural network type, input data, recommendation approach (content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or both), and task (standard or sequential music recommendation). In addition, we discuss major challenges faced in MRS, in particular in the context of the current research on deep learning."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are widely used for suggesting books, education materials, and products to users by exploring their behaviors. In reality, users' preferences often change over time, leading to studies on time-dependent recommender systems. However, most existing approaches that deal with time information remain primitive. In this paper, we extend existing methods and propose a hidden semi-Markov model to track the change of users' interests. Particularly, this model allows for capturing the different durations of user stays in a (latent) interest state, which can better model the heterogeneity of user interests and focuses. We derive an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters of the framework and predict users' actions. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art time-dependent and static benchmark methods. Further analyses of the experiment results indicate that the performance improvement is related to the heterogeneity of state durations and the drift of user interests in the dataset."

    "abstract": "As a prevalent metabolic disease, diabetes has different side effects and causes a wide range of co morbidity with a high rate of mortality. There is a need for certain interventions to manage this disease. Iranians usually have three main meals a day. Considering the special needs of diabetic patients and the possibility of hypoglycemia between the main meals, it is essential for these patients to eat something as a snack. Considering these conditions and the society's orientation towards modern technologies such as smart phones, designing mobile-based nutrition recommender systems can be helpful.The snack recommender system is a knowledge-based smart phone application. This study has focused on the development of a recommender system that combines artificial intelligence techniques and makes up a knowledge base according to the guidelines posed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The snack menu was recommended in accordance with the patient's favorites and conditions. The accuracy of the recommended menu was assessed in 2 steps. First, it was compared with the diet prescribed by three nutrition specialists. In the second step, system's suggested menu was evaluated by the data from 30 diabetic patients using a valid questionnaire.The results of evaluating the snack recommender system by nutritionists showed that this system is capable of recommending various snacks according to the season (accuracy of 100%) and personal interests (accuracy of 90%) to diabetic patients. According to health nutritionists, the snacks suggested by this system are matched with Iranian culture. Moreover, the results revealed that a higher body mass index (BMI) makes the recommender system less sensitive to personal interests to suggest what is basically beneficial for one's health.This study was a pioneering research to develop a more comprehensive dietary recommender system for diabetic patients which includes main meals as well. Patients found the system useful and were satisfied with the application. This system is believed to be able to help diabetic patients to take more healthy diet which leads to a better lifestyle."

    "abstract": "Recent research has identified significant vulnerabilities in recommender systems. Shilling attacks, in which attackers introduce biased ratings in order to influence future recommendations, have been shown to be effective against collaborative filtering algorithms. We postulate that the distribution of item ratings in time can reveal the presence of a wide range of shilling attacks given reasonable assumptions about their duration. To construct a time series of ratings for an item, we use a window size of k to group consecutive ratings for the item into disjoint windows and compute the sample average and sample entropy in each window. We derive a theoretically optimal window size to best detect an attack event if the number of attack profiles is known. For practical applications where this number is unknown, we propose a heuristic algorithm that adaptively changes the window size. Our experimental results demonstrate that monitoring rating distributions in time series is an effective approach for detecting shilling attacks."

This paper provides a summary of the state-of-the-art of so-called food recommender systems, highlighting both seminal and most recent approaches to the problem, as well as important specializations, such as food recommendation systems for groups of users or systems which promote healthy eating. We moreover discuss the diverse challenges involved in designing recsys for food, summarise the lessons learned from past research and outline what we believe to be important future directions and open questions for the field. In providing these contributions we hope to provide a useful resource for researchers and practitioners alike."

Most of the current social network applications have been designed for high-end mobile devices, and they rely upon features such as GPS, capabilities of the world wide web, and rich media support. However, a significant fraction of mobile user base, especially in the developing world, own low-end devices that are only capable of voice and short text messages (SMS). In this context, a natural question is whether one can design meaningful social network-based applications that can work well with these simple devices, and if so, what the real challenges are. Towards answering these questions, this paper presents a social network-based recommender system that has been explicitly designed to work even with devices that just support phone calls and SMS. Our design of the social network based recommender system incorporates three features that complement each other to derive highly targeted ads. First, we analyze information such as customer's address books to estimate the level of social affinity among various users. This social affinity information is used to identify the recommendations to be sent to an individual user. Second, we combine the social affinity information with the spatio-temporal context of users and historical responses of the user to further refine the set of recommendations and to decide when a recommendation would be sent. Third, social affinity computation and spatio-temporal contextual association are continuously tuned through user feedback. We outline the challenges in building such a system, and outline approaches to deal with such challenges."

As input data the following are taken: shopping basket archives, ratings of the products or servers log files. The article presents a solution of recommender system which helps users to select an interesting product. The system analyses data from other customers' ratings of the products. It uses clustering methods to find similarities among the users and proposed techniques to identify users' profiles. The system was implemented in Apache Mahout environment and tested on a movie database.

    "abstract": "We study the properties of a three-step approach to estimating the parameters of a latent structure model for categorical data and propose a simple correction for a common source of bias. Such models have a measurement part (essentially the latent class model) and a structural (causal) part (essentially a system of logit equations). In the three-step approach, a stand-alone measurement model is first defined and its parameters are estimated. Individual predicted scores on the latent variables are then computed from the parameter estimates of the measurement model and the individual observed scoring patterns on the indicators. Finally, these predicted scores are used in the causal part and treated as observed variables. We show that such a naive use of predicted latent scores cannot be recommended since it leads to a systematic underestimation of the strength of the association among the variables in the structural part of the models. However, a simple correction procedure can eliminate this systematic bias. This approach is illustrated on simulated and real data. A method that uses multiple imputation to account for the fact that the predicted latent variables are random variables can produce standard errors for the parameters in the structural part of the model."

It is an integral function of the primary care medical home and an appropriate responsibility of all pediatric health care professionals. This statement provides an algorithm as a strategy to support health care professionals in developing a pattern and practice for addressing developmental concerns in children from birth through 3 years of age. The authors recommend that developmental surveillance be incorporated at every well-child preventive care visit. Any concerns raised during surveillance should be promptly addressed with standardized developmental screening tests. In addition, screening tests should be administered regularly at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month visits. (Because the 30-month visit is not yet a part of the preventive care system and is often not reimbursable by third-party payers at this time, developmental screening can be performed at 24 months of age. In addition, because the frequency of regular pediatric visits decreases after 24 months of age, a pediatrician who expects that his or her patients will have difficulty attending a 30-month visit should conduct screening during the 24-month visit.) The early identification of developmental problems should lead to further developmental and medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment, including early developmental intervention. Children diagnosed with developmental disorders should be identified as children with special health care needs, and chronic-condition management should be initiated. Identification of a developmental disorder and its underlying etiology may also drive a range of treatment planning, from medical treatment of the child to family planning for his or her parents."

    "title": "A recommender system for requirements elicitation in large-scale software projects",
    "abstract": "In large and complex software projects, the knowledge needed to elicit requirements and specify the functional and behavioral properties can be dispersed across many thousands of stakeholders. Unfortunately traditional requirements engineering techniques, which were primarily designed to support face-to-face meetings, do not scale well to handle the needs of larger projects. We therefore propose a semi-automated requirements elicitation framework which uses data-mining techniques and recommender system technologies to facilitate stakeholder collaboration in a large-scale, distributed project. Our proposed recommender model is a hybrid one designed to manage the placement of stakeholders into highly focused discussion forums, where they can work collaboratively to generate requirements. In our approach, statements of need are first gathered from the project stakeholders; unsupervised clustering techniques are then used to identify cohesive and finely-grained themes and a users' profile is constructed according to the interests of the stakeholders in each of these themes. This profile feeds information to a collaborative recommender, which predicts stakeholders' interests in additional forums. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed recommendation framework is evaluated through a series of experiments using feature requests from three software systems."

    "abstract": "Adaptive applications may benefit from having models of users' personality to adapt their behavior accordingly. There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed TP2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the users' personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality"

    "title": "Pistis: A Privacy-Preserving Content Recommender System for Online Social Communities",
    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of online social communities and massive user-generated content, privacy-preserving recommender systems, which identify information of interest to individual users without disclosing personal interests to other parties, have become increasingly important. Collaborative filtering (CF), a widely used recommendation technique, recommends content that similar users have liked. As a result, CF-based recommender systems may expose sensitive personal interest information. This is demonstrated by a privacy attack model we present that targets online social communities. To solve this problem, we propose an interest group based privacy-preserving recommender system called Pistis. By identifying inherent item-user interest groups and separating users' private interests from their public interests, Pistis can make recommendations based on aggregated judgments of group members and local personalization, thus avoiding the disclosure of personal interest information. Pistis has been deployed and evaluated in an online social community with over 63,000 users, 20,000 daily posts, and 180,000 daily reads. Compared with two representative CF-based methods, our evaluation results demonstrate that Pistis achieves better performance in privacy preservation, recommendation quality, and efficiency."

These systems are used in different domains including products, videos, images, articles, news and books. Several recommender systems have been designed for recommending books. However, the available book recommenders face several issues in making relevant book recommendations because most of these do not take into account the book contents at deeper level and process only the mere descriptions about books on web pages along with metadata and other rating information. In order to cope with this issue, we present a hybrid book recommender that recommends books by using book table of contents (TOC) along with association rule mining and opinions of similar users."

Through experiments we realized that the affiliation factors are very much needed for improving the accuracy of the recommender systems. This information helps us to overcome the cold start problem of the recommendation system and also y the analysis this information was much useful to cold users than to heavy users. In our experiments simple neighborhood model outperform the computerized matrix factorization models in the hot voting and non hot voting recommendation. We also proposed a hybrid recommender system producing a top-k recommendation inculcating different single approaches."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are gaining traction in healthcare because they can tailor recommendations based on users' feedback concerning their appreciation of previous health-related messages. However, recommender systems are often not grounded in behavioral change theories, which may further increase the effectiveness of their recommendations. This paper's objective is to describe principles for designing and developing a health recommender system grounded in the I-Change behavioral change model that shall be implemented through a mobile app for a smoking cessation support clinical trial. We built upon an existing smoking cessation health recommender system that delivered motivational messages through a mobile app. A group of experts assessed how the system may be improved to address the behavioral change determinants of the I-Change behavioral change model. The resulting system features a hybrid recommender algorithm for computer tailoring smoking cessation messages. A total of 331 different motivational messages were designed using 10 health communication methods. The algorithm was designed to match 58 message characteristics to each user profile by following the principles of the I-Change model and maintaining the benefits of the recommender system algorithms. The mobile app resulted in a streamlined version that aimed to improve the user experience, and this system's design bridges the gap between health recommender systems and the use of behavioral change theories. This article presents a novel approach integrating recommender system technology, health behavior technology, and computer-tailored technology. Future researchers will be able to build upon the principles applied in this case study."

    "title": "Content-based group recommender systems: A general taxonomy and further improvements",
    "abstract": "Group recommender systems have emerged as a solution to recommend interesting, suitable, and useful items that are consumed socially by groups of people, rather than individually. Such systems have pushed for the use of new recommendation methods within such an emerging scenario, in which the use of the collaborative filtering paradigm is the core of the recommender algorithm. However, collaborative filtering presents several drawbacks and limitations in this scenario, such as the need for lots of rating values, as well as their co-occurrence across several items and users (scarcity). In order to overcome these drawbacks, this research explores a taxonomy for content-based group recommendation systems (CB-GRS), and subsequently the paper discusses and analyzes three specific models that can be used to build CB-GRS, which are (1) CB-GRSs supported by recommendation aggregation and individual ranking, (2) CB-GRSs supported by recommendation aggregation and user-item matching, and (3) CB-GRSs supported by the aggregation of user profiles. Furthermore, the paper presents a hybrid CB-GRS that combines the models (2) and (3) and integrates feature weighting and aggregation function switching. An experimental protocol over well-known datasets is then developed in order to evaluate the proposals. The current study aims at providing a basis to develop a research branch concerning content-based group recommender systems."

    "abstract": "In order to innovatively solve cold-start problems, research involving trust and socially aware recommender systems is currently proliferating. The relative importance of academic conferences has led to the necessity of recommender systems that seek to generate recommendations for conference attendees. In this paper, we aim to improve the recommendation accuracy of socially-aware recommender systems by proposing a linear hybrid recommender algorithm called Personality and Socially-Aware Recommender (PerSAR). PerSAR hybridizes the social and personality behaviours of smart conference attendees. Our recommendation methodology mainly aims to employ an algorithmic framework that computes the personality similarities and tie strengths of conference attendees so that effective and reliable recommendations can be generated for them using a relevant dataset. The experimental results substantiate that our proposed recommendation method is favorable and outperforms other related and contemporary recommendation methods and techniques."

Medications were recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound RCT (class I or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Recommendations for treatment were based on the degree of evidence of analgesic efficacy, safety and ease of use.Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Tramadol and controlled-release opioid analgesics are recommended as second-line treatments for moderate to severe pain. Cannabinoids are now recommended as third-line treatments. Recommended fourth-line treatments include methadone, anticonvulsants with lesser evidence of efficacy (eg, lamotrigine, lacosamide), tapentadol and botulinum toxin. There is support for some analgesic combinations in selected NeP conditions.These guidelines provide an updated, stepwise approach to the pharmacological management of NeP. Treatment should be individualized for each patient based on efficacy, side-effect profile and drug accessibility, including cost. Additional studies are required to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes and treatment of pediatric, geriatric and central NeP."

Based on the personal historical record, the recommender system can find interesting and relevant objects for the user within a huge information space. Many physical processes such as the mass diffusion and heat conduction have been applied to design the recommendation algorithms. The hybridization of these two algorithms has been shown to provide both accurate and diverse recommendation results. In this paper, we proposed two similarity preferential diffusion processes. Extensive experimental analyses on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that both recommendation and accuracy and diversity are improved duet to the similarity preference in the diffusion. The hybridization of the similarity preferential diffusion processes is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-art recommendation algorithm. Finally, our analysis on network sparsity show that there is significant difference between dense and sparse system, indicating that all the former conclusions on recommendation in the literature should be reexamined in sparse system."

First, we lay out some of the theoretical background for social, open-rating mechanisms in online learning systems. We discuss concepts such as social versus black-box recommendations and the advice of neighbors as opposed to that of friends. We argue that enabling subjective views and ratings of other users is an inevitable phase of social collaboration systems. We also argue that social recommendations are critical for the exploitation of the value associated with recommendation."

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems, these days, are no longer personal recommender systems, rather they are group recommender systems which list out recommendations for a group of users. Also, they are an integral part of today's web sites (mainly shopping, search engine etc.) who want to keep track of their users' preferences. Although we cannot build a recommender system for every individual, we can build a recommender system which considers the preferences of a group of users. Hence the concept of group recommendation is even more difficult. Recent researches transpire that there is no efficient group recommendation technique available in the market and also the techniques developed till date are good for individual application or web sites. In this paper we have proposed a new approach to group recommender system using collaborative filtering technique which is one of the two techniques of building recommender systems. In our proposed method we have combined the features of item-item collaborative filtering as well as user-user collaborative filtering to make efficient group recommendation by making homogeneous groups. We have also made a sincere attempt to list out the precision of our group recommender system by using the movie lens data set which is mostly used worldwide for recommender system testing."

    "title": "Pseudo Dyna-Q",
    "abstract": "Applying reinforcement learning (RL) in recommender systems is attractive but costly due to the constraint of the interaction with real customers, where performing online policy learning through interacting with real customers usually harms customer experiences. A practical alternative is to build a recommender agent offline from logged data, whereas directly using logged data offline leads to the problem of selection bias between logging policy and the recommendation policy. The existing direct offline learning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo methods and temporal difference methods are either computationally expensive or unstable on convergence. To address these issues, we propose Pseudo Dyna-Q (PDQ). In PDQ, instead of interacting with real customers, we resort to a customer simulator, referred to as the World Model, which is designed to simulate the environment and handle the selection bias of logged data. During policy improvement, the World Model is constantly updated and optimized adaptively, according to the current recommendation policy. This way, the proposed PDQ not only avoids the instability of convergence and high computation cost of existing approaches but also provides unlimited interactions without involving real customers. Moreover, a proved upper bound of empirical error of reward function guarantees that the learned offline policy has lower bias and variance. Extensive experiments demonstrated the advantages of PDQ on two real-world datasets against state-of-the-arts methods."

    "title": "Online Learning in Large-Scale Contextual Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale, context-aware recommender system that provides accurate recommendations, scalability to a large number of diverse users and items, differential services, and does not suffer from \"cold start\" problems. Our proposed recommendation system relies on a novel algorithm which learns online the item preferences of users based on their click behavior, and constructs online item-cluster trees. The recommendations are then made by choosing an item-cluster level and then selecting an item within that cluster as a recommendation for the user. This approach is able to significantly improve the learning speed when the number of users and items is large, while still providing high recommendation accuracy. Each time a user arrives at the website, the system makes a recommendation based on the estimations of item payoffs by exploiting past context arrivals in a neighborhood of the current user's context. It exploits the similarity of contexts to learn how to make better recommendations even when the number and diversity of users and items is large. This also addresses the cold start problem by using the information gained from similar users and items to make recommendations for new users and items. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm for item recommendations converges to the optimal item recommendations in the long-run. We also bound the probability of making a suboptimal item recommendation for each user arriving to the system while the system is learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by over 20 percent in terms of click through rates."

These learners are differentiated on the basis of their learning styles, goals, knowledge levels and others. Several attempts have been made in the past to design eL_RSs to recommend resources to individuals; however, an investigation of recommendations to a group of learners in e\u2010learning is still in its infancy. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending resources to a group of learners rather than to an individual. The major challenge in group recommendation is how to merge the individual preferences of different learners that form a group and extract a pseudo unified learner profile (ULP) that closely reflects the preferences of all learners. Firstly, we propose a profile merging scheme for the ULP by utilizing learning styles, knowledge levels and ratings of learners in a group. Thereafter, a collaborative approach is proposed based on the ULP for effective group recommendations. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed group recommendation strategy for e\u2010learning."

In this paper, we address the problem of recommending the right locations to users at the right time. We claim to propose the first comprehensive model, called STT (Spatio-Temporal Topic), to capture the spatio-temporal aspects of user check-ins in a single probabilistic model for location recommendation. Our proposed generative model does not only captures spatio-temporal aspects of check-ins, but also profiles users. We conduct experiments on real life data sets from Twitter, Go Walla, and Bright kite. We evaluate the effectiveness of STT by evaluating the accuracy of location recommendation. The experimental results show that STT achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the areas of recommender systems as well as topic modeling."

However, position-bias exists in user feedback because a user clicks on an item may not only because she favors it but also because it is in a good position. One way is to model position as a feature in the training data, which is widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity. Specifically, a default position value has to be used to predict CTR in online inference since the actual position information is not available at that time. However, using different default position values may result in completely different recommendation results. As a result, this approach leads to sub-optimal online performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a <u>P</u>osition-bias <u>A</u>ware <u>L</u>earning framework (PAL) for CTR prediction in a live recommender system. It is able to model the position-bias in offline training and conduct online inference without position information.

For the first time, certain tumour types are defined as much by their molecular phenotype as their histological characteristics; however, in most instances histopathological classification remains the gold standard for diagnosis. The WHO classification of tumours series is designed to be used worldwide, including those settings where a lack of tissue samples or of specific technical facilities limits the pathologist's ability to rely on molecular testing. Table 1. Selected changes within the new classification of tumours of the digestive system Type Subject Change in 2019 classification Oesophageal adenocarcinoma Aetiology and epidemiology The epidemiology has been updated: 7% of cases are thought to be familial, and the risk factors involved in sporadic cases have been updated. The role of gastro-oesophageal reflux in the inflammation\u2013metaplasia\u2013dysplasia adenocarcinoma model has been emphasised Oesophageal adenocarcinoma Prognosis and prediction The use of antibodies targeting ERBB2 (HER2) in patients overexpressing this molecule is included, and the need for testing Oesophageal squamous carcinoma and oesophageal squamous dysplasia Aetiology and pathogenesis The potential role of HPV remains uncertain. Other environmental factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption appear to be more important. The importance of TP53 mutation is now clear, and studies have identified alterations in genes that regulate cell cycle, cell differentiation (especially NOTCH pathway) and EGFR (HER1) signalling as key genetic abnormalities Gastric adenocarcinoma Aetiology and pathogenesis Most sporadic gastric cancers are now considered to be inflammation-driven, and their aetiology is characteristically environmental \u2013 usually related to Helicobacter pylori infection. Up to 10% of gastric cancers are familial. Other factors include tobacco smoking, irradiation and diet. Molecular subtypes as proposed by two consortia are described, although clinical application is limited Gastric adenocarcinoma Classification Heterogeneity of poorly cohesive carcinoma (PCC) is discussed, including signet-ring cell carcinoma and PCC-NOS. Rare subtypes are described, such as gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic-gland type Gastric adenocarcinoma Prognosis and prediction ERBB2 testing is used to predict potential response to anti-ERBB2 therapy. MSI-H and EBV positivity are markers of good prognosis with potential therapeutic importance, namely for immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis (under investigation in clinical trials). A large number of other reported markers are described, but not yet in practice Small intestinal and ampullary carcinomas Pathogenesis These are split into ampullary and non-ampullary types, on the basis of anatomy. Pathogenesis seems similar to colorectal carcinoma, though more information is required Goblet cell adenocarcinoma of the appendix Classification This is a change from goblet cell carcinoid/carcinoma as it is now recognised to have a minor neuroendocrine component Serrated lesions of the colon, rectum and appendix Classification and pathogenesis The preferred name is serrated lesion, as these may be flat rather than polypoid, and the association with BRAF or KRAS mutation delineates two separate neoplastic pathways Anal squamous dysplasia Diagnostic molecular pathology P16 and HPV testing is recommended Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) Classification and molecular pathology The general principles of the new classification of neuroendocrine tumours (NET) will be applied to the entire 5th series, based on a consensus meeting in Lyon (1), dividing NEN into NET and neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) based on their molecular differences. Mutations in MEN1, DAXX and ATRX are entity-defining for well-differentiated NETs, while NECs usually have TP53 or RB1 mutations Precursor lesions Classification The term \u2018dysplasia\u2019 is preferred for lesions in the tubal gut, whereas \u2018intra-epithelial neoplasia\u2019 is preferred for those in the pancreas, gallbladder and biliary tree. Use of the term \u2018carcinoma in situ\u2019 is not recommended Hepatocellular tumours Classification Revision based on molecular profiling studies. Fibrolamellar carcinoma defined by DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA translocation Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Classification Two main subtypes: a large duct type, which resembles extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and a small duct type, which shares aetiological, pathogenetic and imaging characteristics with hepatocellular carcinoma Pancreatic intraductal neoplasms Classification Intraductal oncocytic papillary and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms are distinguished from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and ductal adenocarcinoma by the absence of KRAS in these lesions Acinar cystic transformation of the pancreas Classification Previously called acinar cell cystadenoma, but now demonstrated to be non-neoplastic by molecular clonality analysis Haematolymphoid tumours and mesenchymal tumours Classification Grouped together in separate chapters, to ensure consistency and avoid duplication EBV-positive inflammatory follicular dendritic cell sarcoma of the digestive tract Classification This name change is necessary due to new information on the EBV relationship of this tumour type, previously known as \u2018inflammatory pseudotumour-like fibroblastic/follicular dendritic cell tumour\u2019 Genetic tumour syndromes of the digestive system Classification, pathogenesis and diagnostic molecular pathology Common syndromes are updated. A new section on GAPPS (gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach) syndrome is presented. Tumour predisposition syndromes that confer a raised risk of various gastrointestinal tumours are described EBV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus; HPV, Human papillomavirus; PD-1, Programmed death 1; PD-L1, Programmed death ligand; NOS, Not otherwise specified; EGFR, Epidermal growth factor receptor; HER1, Human epidermal growth factor receptor 1. Rindi et al.3 Since the publication of the 4th-edition digestive system tumours volume in 2010,1 there have been important developments in our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of many tumours. However, the extent to which this new information has altered clinical practice has been quite variable. For some of the tumours described in this volume there is little molecular pathology in clinical use, despite the fact that we now have a more detailed understanding of their molecular pathogenesis. A tumour's molecular pathology, as defined for the purposes of this publication, concerns the molecular markers that are relevant to the tumour's diagnosis, biological behaviour, outcome and treatment, rather than its molecular pathogenesis. However, the role of molecular pathology is expanding; for some tumour entities, molecular analysis is now essential for establishing an accurate diagnosis. Some of these analyses require investigation of somatic (acquired) genetic alterations, gene or protein expression, or even circulating tumour markers. For certain tumour types, specific analytical tests are needed to predict prognosis or tumour progression, and these tests are carefully outlined in this volume. In the following paragraphs, we have summarised some of the more notable changes since the 4th edition. In instances where the new WHO classification of tumours editorial board determined that there was insufficient evidence of the diagnostic or clinical relevance of new information about a particular tumour entity, the position held in the 4th edition has been maintained as the standard in the new volume. Oesophageal and gastric tumours There has been substantial progress in our understanding of the development of glandular oesophageal neoplasia and the sequential neoplastic progression from inflammation to metaplasia (Barrett's oesophagus), dysplasia and, ultimately, adenocarcinoma. This process is initially driven by gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, which leads to reprogramming of cell differentiation and proliferation in the oesophagus. There is evidence that TP53 mutation in proliferating epithelium leads to high-grade dysplasia, while SMAD4 mutation precedes the development of invasive carcinoma. While demonstration of these mutations is not required clinically, testing oesophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas for ERBB2 [human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)] is recommended, as this influences treatment decisions. The pathogenesis of precursor lesions is less clear in oesophageal squamous carcinogenesis than in gastric carcinogenesis. Environmental factors are believed to play an important role, but the mechanisms of neoplastic change as a result of specific factors, such as tobacco use and alcohol consumption, are poorly understood. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was initially believed to play a key role in squamous carcinogenesis, but recent evidence suggests that there is no such association in most cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The molecular pathway of cancer progression in the stomach is less clear. Most epidemic gastric cancers are now considered inflammation-driven, and their aetiology is characteristically environmental \u2013 usually related to Helicobacter pylori infection. It is because of this infectious aetiology that gastric cancer is included among the limited number of highly lethal, but preventable, cancers. Chronic gastric inflammation leads to changes in the microenvironment (including the microbiome) that results in mucosal atrophy/metaplasia, which may then progress to neoplasia after further molecular alterations. Metaplastic changes in the upper gastrointestinal tract are well-recognised as early cancer precursors, but their precise molecular mechanisms and the exact role of progenitor cells in the oncogenic cascade remain a subject of intense investigation. For some rare tumours, distinctive driver mutations have been identified; for example, the characteristic MALAT1\u2013GLI1 fusion gene in gastroblastoma and EWSR1 fusions in gastrointestinal clear cell sarcoma and malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumour. In both examples, demonstration of the fusion gene is now required for the diagnosis. Tumours of the anus, small and large intestines The pathogenesis of adenocarcinomas of the intestines (the small and large bowel and the appendix) is now much better delineated than it was a decade ago. The introduction of population-based screening for colorectal cancer has laid the foundation for a better understanding of neoplastic precursor lesions and the molecular pathways associated with each type of tumour. For example, our knowledge of the molecular pathways and biological behaviour of conventional adenomas and serrated precursor lesions, including the recently renamed sessile serrated lesion (formerly called sessile serrated polyp/adenoma), has grown rapidly in the past decade, and this has enabled clinicians to provide tailored, evidence-driven screening and surveillance programmes. Colorectal cancers, in which it will make a difference to patient treatment, should undergo molecular testing for microsatellite instability and extended RAS testing for mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF. Our understanding of appendiceal tumours has also improved. For example, we now know that many tumours of the appendix develop via neoplastic precursor lesions similar to those in the small and large intestines, and the biological potential and molecular pathways of appendiceal tumours are therefore much better appreciated. The recently renamed goblet cell adenocarcinoma (formerly called goblet cell carcinoid/carcinoma) of the appendix is a prime example of a tumour whose biological potential and histological characteristics have been better described, resulting in improvements in the pathological approach to these tumours. Studies of the aetiology and pathogenesis of anal squamous lesions suggests that HPV infection plays an important aetiological role, driving genetic alterations similar to those in cervical cancer. p16 and HPV testing are recommended for such lesions. Neuroendocrine neoplasms One particularly important change in the 5th edition is in the classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), which occur in multiple sites throughout the body. In this volume, NENs are covered within each organ-specific chapter, including the chapter on tumours of the pancreas, where detailed sections describing each functioning and non-functioning subtype are provided. Previously, these neoplasms were covered only in the volume on tumours of endocrine organs.2 The general principles guiding the classification of all NENs are presented in a separate introduction to this topic (Table 2). To consolidate our increased understanding of the genetics of these neoplasms, a group of experts met for a consensus conference at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in November 2017 and subsequently published a paper in which they proposed distinguishing between well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) in all sites where these neoplasms arise.3 NEN are divided into NET and NECs, based on their molecular differences. Mutations in MEN1, DAXX and ATRX are entity-defining for well-differentiated NETs, whereas NECs usually have TP53 or RB1 mutations. In some cases, these mutations can be of diagnostic benefit. Genomic data have also led to a change in the classification of mixed NENs, which are now grouped into the conceptual category of \u2018mixed neuroendocrine\u2013non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs)\u2019. Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs), which show genomic alterations similar to those of adenocarcinomas or NECs rather than NETs, probably reflect clonal evolution within the tumours, which is a rapidly growing area of interest. The study of these mixed carcinomas may also lead to an improved understanding of other facets of clonality in tumours of the digestive system and other parts of the body. Table 2. Classification and grading criteria for neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the GI tract and hepatopancreatobiliary organs Terminology Differentiation Grade Mitotic rate* (mitoses/2 mm2) Ki-67 index* NET, G1 Well differentiated Low <2 <3% NET, G2 Intermediate 2\u201320 3\u201320% NET, G3 High >20 >20% NEC, small-cell type (SCNEC) Poorly differentiated High\u2020 >20 >20% NEC, large-cell type (LCNEC) >20 >20% MiNEN Well or poorly differentiated\u2021 Variable\u2021 Variable\u2021 Variable\u2021 LCNEC, Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma; MiNEN, Mixed neuroendocrine\u2013non-neuroendocrine neoplasm; NEC, Neuroendocrine carcinoma; NET, Neuroendocrine tumour; SCNEC, Small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. * Mitotic rates are to be expressed as the number of mitoses/2 mm2 as determined by counting in 50 fields of 0.2 mm2 (i.e. in a total area of 10 mm2); the Ki-67 proliferation index value is determined by counting at least 500 cells in the regions of highest labelling (hot-spots), which are identified at scanning magnification; the final grade is based on whichever of the two proliferation indexes places the neoplasm in the higher-grade category. \u2020 Poorly differentiated NECs are not formally graded, but are considered high-grade by definition. \u2021 In most MiNENs, both the neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine components are poorly differentiated, and the neuroendocrine component has proliferation indices in the same range as other NECs, but this conceptual category allows for the possibility that one or both components may be well differentiated; when feasible, each component should therefore be graded separately. Another important change concerns the recognition that well-differentiated NETs may be high grade (G3 in the WHO grading system, defined as having a mitotic rate >20 per 2 mm2 or Ki67 >20%), but these neoplasms remain well-differentiated genetically and distinct from poorly differentiated NECs. G3 NETs were first recognised and are most common in the pancreas, but they can occur throughout the GI tract. Thus, the current WHO classification includes three grades (G1, G2 and G3) for NETs. NECs are no longer graded, as they are recognised to be uniformly high grade by definition, but continue to be separated into small-and large-cell types. Precursor lesions There are certain terms in current day-to-day use about which many pathologists continue to disagree. The editorial board carefully considered our current understanding of carcinogenetic pathways when considering the use of specific terms and definitions. In general, the overall consensus was that established terms, definitions and criteria should not be changed unless there was strong evidence to support doing so and the proposed changes had clinical relevance. For some tumours, our understanding of the progression from normal epithelium to metastatic carcinoma remains inadequate. For example, in certain tumours the line between benign and malignant can be ambiguous, and in some cases the distinction is more definitional than biological. These are some of the many areas of tumour biology that need to be more fully investigated in the future. In the 5th edition, the terminology for precursors to invasive carcinoma in the digestive system has been standardised somewhat, although the terms \u2018dysplasia\u2019 and \u2018intra-epithelial neoplasia\u2019 are both still considered acceptable for lesions in certain anatomical locations, in acknowledgement of their ongoing clinical acceptance. For example, the term \u2018dysplasia\u2019 is preferred for lesions in the tubular gut, whereas \u2018intra-epithelial neoplasia\u2019 is preferred for those in the pancreas, gallbladder and biliary tree. For all anatomical sites, however, a two-tiered system (low- versus high-grade) is considered the standard grading system for neoplastic precursor lesions. This has replaced the three-tiered grading scheme previously used for lesions in the pancreatobiliary system.4 The term \u2018carcinoma in situ\u2019 continues to be strongly discouraged in clinical practice for a variety of reasons, most notably its clinical ambiguity. This term is encompassed by the category of high-grade dysplasia/intraepithelial neoplasia. Liver tumours Many refinements of the 4th-edition classification have been made concerning liver tumours, supported by novel molecular findings. For example, a comprehensive picture of the molecular changes that occur in common hepatocellular carcinoma has recently emerged from large-scale molecular profiling studies. Meanwhile, several rarer hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes, which together may account for 20\u201330% of cases, have been defined by consistent morphomolecular and clinical features, with fibrolamellar carcinoma and its diagnostic DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA translocation being one prime example. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is now understood to be an anatomically defined entity with two different major subtypes: a large duct type, which resembles extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and a small duct type, which shares significant aetiological, pathogenetic and imaging characteristics with hepatocellular carcinoma. The two subtypes have very different aetiologies, molecular alterations, growth patterns and clinical behaviours, exemplifying the conflict between anatomically and histogenetically/pathogenetically based classifications. Clinical research and study protocols will need to incorporate these findings in the near future. Also supported by molecular findings, the definition of combined hepatocellular\u2013cholangiocarcinoma and its distinction from other entities has recently become clearer. Cholangiolocellular carcinoma is no longer considered a subtype of combined hepatocellular\u2013cholangiocarcinoma, but rather a subtype of small duct intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, renamed cholangiolocarcinoma, meaning that all intrahepatic carcinomas with a ductal or tubular phenotype are now included within the category of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A classic example of morphology-based molecular profiling leading to a new classification based on a combination of biological and molecular factors is the classification of hepatocellular adenomas, which has gained a high degree of clinical relevance and has fuelled the implementation of refined morphological criteria and molecular testing in routine diagnostics. Tumours of the pancreas Most of the classification of pancreatic neoplasms in the 5th edition remains unchanged from the last volume. As highlighted above, precursor lesions including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms are now classified into two tiers of dysplasia, based on the highest grade of dysplasia detected, rather than the three-tier system used in the last edition of the WHO classification. Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms are now separated from the other subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm based on their distinct genomic and morphological features. The prior entity of acinar cell cystadenoma, which has recently been demonstrated to be non-neoplastic by molecular clonality analysis, is now termed \u2018acinar cystic transformation of the pancreas\u2019. Also, the entire spectrum of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms is now included in this volume; previously, details concerning the individual functional types were presented in the WHO classification of tumours of the endocrine organs. Mixed tumours Mixed tumours in several anatomical sites (e.g. oesophageal adenosquamous carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma, as well as hepatic carcinomas with mixed hepatocellular and cholangiocellular differentiation), remain subjects of some uncertainty. The relative importance of the various lineages of differentiation within these neoplasms remains unknown. It is also uncertain how these neoplasms develop and how they should be treated. These issues are a matter of debate because hard evidence is lacking, but there are improvements in the pathological criteria and classification of these neoplasms that should help to standardise the diagnostic approach and facilitate better clinical and genomic research. Haematolymphoid tumours and mesenchymal tumours Each of these tumour types is grouped together in separate chapters. This ensures consistency and avoids duplication. The term \u2018EBV positive inflammatory follicular dendritic cell sarcoma of the digestive tract\u2019 has been adopted to replace the entity previously known as \u2018inflammatory pseudotumour-like fibroblastic/follicular dendritic cell tumour\u2019. Genetic tumour syndromes New in this book is the chapter on genetic tumour syndromes of the digestive system, the introduction to which contains a table that lists each of the major syndromes and summarises key information about the disease/phenotype, pattern of inheritance, causative gene(s) and normal function of the encoded protein(s). Common syndromes, including Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis 1 (FAP), are covered in detail, as well as several other adenomatous polyposes defined since the last volume and the GAPPS (gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach) syndrome, now recognised as a FAP variant, with a unique phenotype. A number of other genetic tumour predisposition syndromes that confer a raised risk of various gastrointestinal tumours are also described, including Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, syndromes associated with gastroenteropancreatic NETs and multilocus inherited neoplasia alleles syndrome. This should be helpful to many involved in the diagnosis of such syndromes, as well as those researching the mechanisms involved. Format changes The format of the books has been updated to reflect the new edition of the classification: the move from three to two columns has allowed larger illustrations, and the use of set headings for each tumour type show very clearly where evidence is lacking.

Invoking Lorde, I use the \"master's tools\" as a metaphor for conventional theoretical and methodological approaches and \"dismantle the master's house\" as a metaphor for intersectional structures and systems of oppression that created and sustain health inequity in U.S. Black communities. Using a blend of personal narrative and insights from a 23-year career as a Black critical health equity researcher, I share 10 critical lessons for Black and other health equity researchers of color. And because the personal typically reflects the structural, I recommend system and structural-level mitigation strategies for departments, universities, extramural institutions (e.g., journals), and the government, for each critical lesson."

    "title": "Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy",
    "abstract": "Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a serious and common complication of diabetes. Despite its relationship to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and its association with multiple symptoms and impairments, the significance of DAN has not been fully appreciated. The reported prevalence of DAN varies widely depending on the cohort studied and the methods of assessment. In randomly selected cohorts of asymptomatic individuals with diabetes, \u223c20% had abnormal cardiovascular autonomic function. DAN frequently coexists with other peripheral neuropathies and other diabetic complications, but DAN may be isolated, frequently preceding the detection of other complications. Major clinical manifestations of DAN include resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, gastroparesis, erectile dysfunction, sudomotor dysfunction, impaired neurovascular function, \u201cbrittle diabetes,\u201d and hypoglycemic autonomic failure. DAN may affect many organ systems throughout the body (e.g., gastrointestinal [GI], genitourinary, and cardiovascular). GI disturbances (e.g., esophageal enteropathy, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence) are common, and any section of the GI tract may be affected. Gastroparesis should be suspected in individuals with erratic glucose control. Upper-GI symptoms should lead to consideration of all possible causes, including autonomic dysfunction. Whereas a radiographic gastric emptying study can definitively establish the diagnosis of gastroparesis, a reasonable approach is to exclude autonomic dysfunction and other known causes of these upper-GI symptoms. Constipation is the most common lower-GI symptom but can alternate with episodes of diarrhea. Diagnostic approaches should rule out autonomic dysfunction and the well-known causes such as neoplasia. Occasionally, anorectal manometry and other specialized tests typically performed by the gastroenterologist may be helpful. DAN is also associated with genitourinary tract disturbances including bladder and/or sexual dysfunction. Evaluation of bladder dysfunction should be performed for individuals with diabetes who have recurrent urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, incontinence, or a palpable bladder. Specialized assessment of bladder dysfunction will typically be performed by a urologist. In men, DAN may cause loss of penile erection and/or retrograde ejaculation. A complete workup for erectile dysfunction in men should include history (medical and sexual); psychological evaluation; hormone levels; measurement of nocturnal penile tumescence; tests to assess penile, pelvic, and spinal nerve function; cardiovascular autonomic function tests; and measurement of penile and brachial blood pressure. Neurovascular dysfunction resulting from DAN contributes to a wide spectrum of clinical disorders including erectile dysfunction, loss of skin integrity, and abnormal vascular reflexes. Disruption of microvascular skin blood flow and sudomotor function may be among the earliest manifestations of DAN and lead to dry skin, loss of sweating, and the development of fissures and cracks that allow microorganisms to enter. These changes ultimately contribute to the development of ulcers, gangrene, and limb loss. Various aspects of neurovascular function can be evaluated with specialized tests, but generally these have not been well standardized and have limited clinical utility. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is the most studied and clinically important form of DAN. Meta-analyses of published data demonstrate that reduced cardiovascular autonomic function as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) is strongly (i.e., relative risk is doubled) associated with an increased risk of silent myocardial ischemia and mortality. The determination of the presence of CAN is usually based on a battery of autonomic function tests rather than just on one test. Proceedings from a consensus conference in 1992 recommended that three tests (R-R variation, Valsalva maneuver, and postural blood pressure testing) be used for longitudinal testing of the cardiovascular autonomic system. Other forms of autonomic neuropathy can be evaluated with specialized tests, but these are less standardized and less available than commonly used tests of cardiovascular autonomic function, which quantify loss of HRV. Interpretability of serial HRV testing requires accurate, precise, and reproducible procedures that use established physiological maneuvers. The battery of three recommended tests for assessing CAN is readily performed in the average clinic, hospital, or diagnostic center with the use of available technology. Measurement of HRV at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and within 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (unless an individual has symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction earlier) serves to establish a baseline, with which 1-year interval tests can be compared. Regular HRV testing provides early detection and thereby promotes timely diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. HRV testing may also facilitate differential diagnosis and the attribution of symptoms (e.g., erectile dysfunction, dyspepsia, and dizziness) to autonomic dysfunction. Finally, knowledge of early autonomic dysfunction can encourage patient and physician to improve metabolic control and to use therapies such as ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers, proven to be effective for patients with CAN."

    "abstract": "About 2% of all colorectal cancer occurs in the context of the autosomal dominantly inherited Lynch syndrome, which is due to mutations in mismatch repair genes. Potential risk-reducing interventions are recommended for individuals known to have these mutations.To review cancer risks and data on screening efficacy in the context of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and to provide recommendations for clinical management for affected families, based on available evidence and expert opinion.A systematic literature search using PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, reference list review of retrieved articles, manual searches of relevant articles, and direct communication with other researchers in the field. Search terms included hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, Lynch syndrome, microsatellite instability, mismatch repair genes, and terms related to the biology of Lynch syndrome. Only peer-reviewed, full-text, English-language articles concerning human subjects published between January 1, 1996, and February 2006 were included. The US Preventive Services Task Force's 2-tier system was adapted to describe the quality of evidence and to assign strength to the recommendations for each guideline.The evidence supports colonoscopic surveillance for individuals with Lynch syndrome, although the optimal age at initiation and frequency of examinations is unresolved. Colonoscopy is recommended every 1 to 2 years starting at ages 20 to 25 years (age 30 years for those with MSH6 mutations), or 10 years younger than the youngest age of the person diagnosed in the family. While fully acknowledging absence of demonstrated efficacy, the following are also recommended annually: endometrial sampling and transvaginal ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries (ages 30-35 years); urinalysis with cytology (ages 25-35 years); history, examination, review of systems, education and genetic counseling regarding Lynch syndrome (age 21 years). Regular colonoscopy was favored for at-risk persons without colorectal neoplasia. For individuals who will undergo surgical resection of a colon cancer, subtotal colectomy is favored. Evidence supports the efficacy of prophylactic hysterectomy and oophorectomy.The past 10 years have seen major advances in the understanding of Lynch syndrome. Current recommendations regarding cancer screening and prevention require careful consultation between clinicians, clinical cancer genetic services, and well-informed patients."

    "title": "Unifying explicit and implicit feedback for collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "Most collaborative filtering algorithms are based on certain statistical models of user interests built from either explicit feedback (eg: ratings, votes) or implicit feedback (eg: clicks, purchases). Explicit feedbacks are more precise but more difficult to collect from users while implicit feedbacks are much easier to collect though less accurate in reflecting user preferences. In the existing literature, separate models have been developed for either of these two forms of user feedbacks due to their heterogeneous representation. However in most real world recommended systems both explicit and implicit user feedback are abundant and could potentially complement each other. It is desirable to be able to unify these two heterogeneous forms of user feedback in order to generate more accurate recommendations. In this work, we developed matrix factorization models that can be trained from explicit and implicit feedback simultaneously. Experimental results of multiple datasets showed that our algorithm could effectively combine these two forms of heterogeneous user feedback to improve recommendation quality."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have become paramount to customize information access and reduce information overload. They serve multiple uses, ranging from suggesting products and artifacts (to consumers), to bringing people together by the connections induced by (similar) reactions to products and services. This thesis presents a graph-theoretic model that casts recommendation as a process of \u2018jumping connections\u2019 in a graph. In addition to emphasizing the social network aspect, this viewpoint provides a novel evaluation criterion for recommender systems. Algorithms for recommender systems are distinguished not in terms of predicted ratings of services/artifacts, but in terms of the combinations of people and artifacts that they bring together. We present an algorithmic framework drawn from random graph theory and outline an analysis for one particular form of jump called a \u2018hammock.\u2019 Experimental results on two datasets collected over the Internet demonstrate the validity of this approach."

    "title": "Evaluating compound critiquing recommenders",
    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems are designed to help users to more efficiently navigate complex product spaces by alternatively making recommendations and inviting users' feedback. Compound critiquing techniques provide an efficient way for users to feed back their preferences (in terms of several simultaneous product attributes) when interfacing with conversational recommender systems. For example, in the laptop domain a user might wish to express a preference for a laptop that is \"Cheaper, Lighter, with a Larger Screen\". While recently a number of techniques for dynamically generating compound critiques have been proposed, to date there has been a lack of direct comparison of these approaches in a real-user study. In this paper we will compare two alternative approaches to the dynamic generation of compound critiques based on ideas from data mining and multi-attribute utility theory. We will demonstrate how both approaches support users to more efficiently navigate complex product spaces highlighting, in particular, the influence of product complexity and interface strategy on recommendation performance and user satisfaction."

    "abstract": "Traditional batch model-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches typically assume a collection of users' rating data is given a priori for training the model. They suffer from a common yet critical drawback, i.e., the model has to be re-trained completely from scratch whenever new training data arrives, which is clearly non-scalable for large real recommender systems where users' rating data often arrives sequentially and frequently. In this paper, we investigate a novel efficient and scalable online collaborative filtering technique for on-the-fly recommender systems, which is able to effectively online update the recommendation model from a sequence of rating observations. Specifically, we propose a family of online multi-task collaborative filtering (OMTCF) algorithms, which tackle the online collaborative filtering task by exploiting the similar principle as online multitask learning. Encouraging empirical results on large-scale datasets showed that the proposed technique is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "abstract": "Background: Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is a nervous system infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato ( Bb ). Objectives: To present evidence\u2010based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Data were analysed according to levels of evidence as suggested by EFNS. Recommendations: The following three criteria should be fulfilled for definite LNB, and two of them for possible LNB: (i) neurological symptoms; (ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis; (iii) Bb \u2010specific antibodies produced intrathecally. PCR and CSF culture may be corroborative if symptom duration is &lt;6 weeks, when Bb antibodies may be absent. PCR is otherwise not recommended. There is also not enough evidence to recommend the following tests for diagnostic purposes: microscope\u2010based assays, chemokine CXCL13, antigen detection, immune complexes, lymphocyte transformation test, cyst formation, lymphocyte markers. Adult patients with definite or possible acute LNB (symptom duration &lt;6 months) should be offered a single 14\u2010day course of antibiotic treatment. Oral doxycycline (200 mg daily) and intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2 g daily) are equally effective in patients with symptoms confined to the peripheral nervous system, including meningitis (level A). Patients with CNS manifestations should be treated with IV ceftriaxone (2 g daily) for 14 days and late LNB (symptom duration &gt;6 months) for 3 weeks (good practice points). Children should be treated as adults, except that doxycycline is contraindicated under 8 years of age (nine in some countries). If symptoms persist for more than 6 months after standard treatment, the condition is often termed post\u2010Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS). Antibiotic therapy has no impact on PLDS (level A)."

    "title": "Distributed collaborative filtering with domain specialization",
    "abstract": "User data scarcity has always been indicated among the major problems of collaborative filtering recommender systems. That is, if two users do not share sufficiently large set of items for whom their ratings are known, then the user-to-user similarity computation is not reliable and a rating prediction for one user can not be based on the ratings of the other. This paper shows that this problem can be solved, and that the accuracy of collaborative recommendations can be improved by: a) partitioning the collaborative user data into specialized and distributed repositories, and b) aggregating information coming from these repositories. This paper explores a content-dependent partitioning of collaborative movie ratings, where the ratings are partitioned according to the genre of the movie and presents an evaluation of four aggregation approaches. The evaluation demonstrates that the aggregation improves the accuracy of a centralized system containing the same ratings and proves the feasibility and advantages of a distributed collaborative filtering scenario."

    "title": "Updatable, Accurate, Diverse, and Scalable Recommendations for Interactive Applications",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems form the backbone of many interactive systems. They incorporate user feedback to personalize the user experience typically via personalized recommendation lists. As users interact with a system, an increasing amount of data about a user\u2019s preferences becomes available, which can be leveraged for improving the systems\u2019 performance. Incorporating these new data into the underlying recommendation model is, however, not always straightforward. Many models used by recommender systems are computationally expensive and, therefore, have to perform offline computations to compile the recommendation lists. For interactive applications, it is desirable to be able to update the computed values as soon as new user interaction data is available: updating recommendations in interactive time using new feedback data leads to better accuracy and increases the attraction of the system to the users. Additionally, there is a growing consensus that accuracy alone is not enough and user satisfaction is also dependent on diverse recommendations. In this work, we tackle this problem of updating personalized recommendation lists for interactive applications in order to provide both accurate and diverse recommendations. To that end, we explore algorithms that exploit random walks as a sampling technique to obtain diverse recommendations without compromising on efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we present a novel graph vertex ranking recommendation algorithm called RP 3 \u03b2 that reranks items based on three-hop random walk transition probabilities. We show empirically that RP 3 \u03b2 provides accurate recommendations with high long-tail item frequency at the top of the recommendation list. We also present approximate versions of RP 3 \u03b2 and the two most accurate previously published vertex ranking algorithms based on random walk transition probabilities and show that these approximations converge with an increasing number of samples. To obtain interactively updatable recommendations, we additionally show how our algorithm can be extended for online updates at interactive speeds. The underlying random walk sampling technique makes it possible to perform the updates without having to recompute the values for the entire dataset. In an empirical evaluation with three real-world datasets, we show that RP 3 \u03b2 provides highly accurate and diverse recommendations that can easily be updated with newly gathered information at interactive speeds (\u226a 100 ms )."

In this context, we come to rely on digital artifacts to infer characteristics of other people. This paper reports the results of a study conducted in a global company that used expertise search as a vehicle for exploring how people interpret a range of information available in online profiles in evaluating whom to interact with for expertise. Using signaling theory as a conceptual framework, we describe how certain 'signals' in various social software are hard to fake, and are thus more reliable indicators of expertise. Multi-level regression analysis revealed that participation in social software, social connection information, and self-described expertise in the corporate directory were significantly helpful in the decision to contact someone for expertise. Qualitative analysis provided further insights regarding the interpretations people form of others' expertise from digital artifacts. We conclude with suggestions on differentiating various types of information available within online profiles and implications for the design of expertise locator/recommender systems."

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that neural networks can model survival data in situations in which some patients' death times are unknown, e.g. right-censored. However, neural networks have rarely been shown to outperform their linear counterparts such as the Cox proportional hazards model. In this paper, we run simulated experiments and use real survival data to build upon the risk-regression architecture proposed by Faraggi and Simon. We demonstrate that our model, DeepSurv, not only works as well as other survival models but actually outperforms in predictive ability on survival data with linear and nonlinear risk functions. We then show that the neural network can also serve as a recommender system by including a categorical variable representing a treatment group. This can be used to provide personalized treatment recommendations based on an individual's calculated risk. We provide an open source Python module that implements these methods in order to advance research on deep learning and survival analysis."

    "abstract": "The impact of data characteristics on the performance of classical recommender systems has been recently investigated and produced fruitful results about the relationship they have with recommendation accuracy. This work provides a systematic study on the impact of broadly chosen data characteristics (DCs) of recommender systems. This is applied to the accuracy and fairness of several variations of CF recommendation models. We focus on a suite of DCs that capture properties about the structure of the user\u2013item interaction matrix, the rating frequency, item properties, or the distribution of rating values. Experimental validation of the proposed system involved large-scale experiments by performing 23,400 recommendation simulations on three real-world datasets in the movie (ML-100K and ML-1M) and book domains (BookCrossing). The validation results show that the investigated DCs in some cases can have up to 90% of explanatory power \u2013 on several variations of classical CF algorithms \u2013, while they can explain \u2013 in the best case \u2013 about 40% of fairness results (measured according to user gender and age sensitive attributes). Therefore, this work evidences that it is more difficult to explain variations in performance when dealing with fairness dimension than accuracy."

However, most studies aim at imposing rules to improve lifestyle, rather than recommending nutrition and physical activities. In this context, this study aims to develop a system for recommending physical activities for hypertensive patients to create opportunities for the patients so they can search for and create a healthy lifestyle. To achieve this goal, we elaborated on a hypertensive user profile model, called HyperModel2PAR, and a physical activity recommender system for hypertensive patients, called HyperRecSysPA. The model resulting from this study is composed of 32 elements divided into three groups, which were used in the modeling of user profiles within the system for generating HyperRecSysPA recommendations. The developed system was validated by physicians who answered a specific questionnaire. As a result, ~75% of the recommendations generated were approved. Therefore, this study has prospective contributions to the literature, since both models obtained conclusive results in the assessments performed."

However, as people become more dependent on them, recent studies show that recommender systems potentially own unintentional impacts on society and individuals because of their unfairness (e.g., gender discrimination in job recommendations). To develop trustworthy services, it is crucial to devise fairness-aware recommender systems that can mitigate these bias issues. In this survey, we summarise existing methodologies and practices of fairness in recommender systems. Firstly, we present concepts of fairness in different recommendation scenarios, comprehensively categorize current advances, and introduce typical methods to promote fairness in different stages of recommender systems. Next, after introducing datasets and evaluation metrics applied to assess the fairness of recommender systems, we will delve into the significant influence that fairness-aware recommender systems exert on real-world industrial applications. Subsequently, we highlight the connection between fairness and other principles of trustworthy recommender systems, aiming to consider trustworthiness principles holistically while advocating for fairness. Finally, we summarize this review, spotlighting promising opportunities in comprehending concepts, frameworks, the balance between accuracy and fairness, and the ties with trustworthiness, with the ultimate goal of fostering the development of fairness-aware recommender systems."

Travel recommender systems have been embraced by many researchers due to recent developments and significant requirements in the e-tourism domain. Generating personalised recommendations with minimal interactions is a key challenge and predicting personalised list of locations with the available ratings alone cannot achieve effective recommendations. To address this issue, we develop an intelligent real-time user-specific travel recommender system (IRTUSTRS) through incorporating users' social network profile and current location by exploiting global positioning system (GPS) data for travel recommendation generation. The proposed IRTUSTRS approach helps end users through enhanced travel recommendations with improved accuracy. The experimental evaluation portrays the improved performance of IRTUSTRS over baseline approaches. The presented work helps to understand the performance of recommender systems by utilising online social network profile of users with the current location through the GPS data."

    "abstract": "Abstract Recommender systems are used to suggest items to users based on their interests. They have been used widely in various domains, including online stores, web advertisements, and social networks. As part of their process, recommender systems use a set of similarity measurements that would assist in finding interesting items. Although many similarity measurements have been proposed in the literature, they have not concentrated on actual user interests. This paper proposes a new efficient hybrid similarity measure for recommender systems based on user interests. This similarity measure is a combination of two novel base similarity measurements: the user interest\u2013user interest similarity measure and the user interest\u2013item similarity measure. This hybrid similarity measure improves the existing work in three aspects. First, it improves the current recommender systems by using actual user interests. Second, it provides a comprehensive evaluation of an efficient solution to the cold start problem. Third, this similarity measure works well even when no corated items exist between two users. Our experiments show that our proposed similarity measure is efficient in terms of accuracy, execution time, and applicability. Specifically, our proposed similarity measure achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 0.42, with 64% applicability and an execution time as low as 0.03 s, whereas the existing similarity measures from the literature achieve an MAE of 0.88 at their best; these results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed similarity measure in terms of accuracy, as well as having a high applicability percentage and a very short execution time."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) provides a great opportunity to satisfy the strong demand for personalized Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation services. However, with the tremendous increase of users and POIs, POI recommender systems still face several challenging problems: (1) the hardness of modeling complex user-POI interactions from sparse implicit feedback; (2) the difficulty of incorporating the geographical context information. To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel autoencoder-based model to learn the complex user-POI relations, namely SAE-NAD, which consists of a self-attentive encoder (SAE) and a neighbor-aware decoder (NAD). In particular, unlike previous works equally treat users' checked-in POIs, our self-attentive encoder adaptively differentiates the user preference degrees in multiple aspects, by adopting a multi-dimensional attention mechanism. To incorporate the geographical context information, we propose a neighbor-aware decoder to make users' reachability higher on the similar and nearby neighbors of checked-in POIs, which is achieved by the inner product of POI embeddings together with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with many state-of-the-art methods and evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."

We find that for the first few ratings a baseline algorithm performs better than three common collaborative filtering algorithms. Once we have a few ratings, we find that Funk's SVD algorithm has the best overall performance. We also find that ItemItem, a very commonly deployed algorithm, performs very poorly for new users. Our results can inform the design of interfaces and algorithms for new users."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are becoming a salient part of many e-commerce websites. Much research has focused on advancing recommendation technologies to improve accuracy of predictions, while behavioral aspects of using recommender systems are often overlooked. In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer\u2019s constructed preference. Viewers\u2019 preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system. These general findings have a number of important implications (e.g., on recommender systems performance metrics and design, preference bias, potential strategic behavior, and trust), which are discussed."

    "abstract": "Automated platforms which support users in finding a mutually beneficial match, such as online dating and job recruitment sites, are becoming increasingly popular. These platforms often include recommender systems that assist users in finding a suitable match. While recommender systems which provide explanations for their recommendations have shown many benefits, explanation methods have yet to be adapted and tested in recommending suitable matches. In this paper, we introduce and extensively evaluate the use of \"reciprocal explanations\" - explanations which provide reasoning as to why both parties are expected to benefit from the match. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, in both simulated and real-world dating platforms with 287 human participants, we find that when the acceptance of a recommendation involves a significant cost (e.g., monetary or emotional), reciprocal explanations outperform standard explanation methods, which consider the recommendation receiver alone. However, contrary to what one may expect, when the cost of accepting a recommendation is negligible, reciprocal explanations are shown to be less effective than the traditional explanation methods."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of keyword extraction from conversations, with the goal of using these keywords to retrieve, for each short conversation fragment, a small number of potentially relevant documents, which can be recommended to participants. However, even a short fragment contains a variety of words, which are potentially related to several topics; moreover, using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system introduces errors among them. Therefore, it is difficult to infer precisely the information needs of the conversation participants. We first propose an algorithm to extract keywords from the output of an ASR system (or a manual transcript for testing), which makes use of topic modeling techniques and of a submodular reward function which favors diversity in the keyword set, to match the potential diversity of topics and reduce ASR noise. Then, we propose a method to derive multiple topically separated queries from this keyword set, in order to maximize the chances of making at least one relevant recommendation when using these queries to search over the English Wikipedia. The proposed methods are evaluated in terms of relevance with respect to conversation fragments from the Fisher, AMI, and ELEA conversational corpora, rated by several human judges. The scores show that our proposal improves over previous methods that consider only word frequency or topic similarity, and represents a promising solution for a document recommender system to be used in conversations."

    "abstract": "Recently, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing demand for online education platforms. However, it is challenging to correctly choose course content from among many online education resources due to the differences in users\u2019 knowledge structures. Therefore, a course recommender system has the essential role of improving the learning efficiency of users. At present, many online education platforms have built diverse recommender systems that utilize traditional data mining methods, such as Collaborative Filtering (CF). Despite the development and contributions of many recommender systems based on CF, diverse deep learning models for personalized recommendation are being studied because of problems such as sparsity and scalability. Therefore, to solve traditional recommendation problems, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based course recommender system (DECOR), which elaborately captures high-level user behaviors and course attribute features. The DECOR model can reduce information overload, solve high-dimensional data sparsity problems, and achieve high feature information extraction performance. We perform several experiments utilizing real-world datasets to evaluate the DECOR model\u2019s performance compared with that of traditional recommendation approaches. The experimental results indicate that the DECOR model offers better and more robust recommendation performance than the traditional methods."

    "abstract": "Because of the large number of online games available nowadays, online game recommender systems are necessary for users and online game platforms. The former can discover more potential online games of their interests, and the latter can attract users to dwell longer in the platform. This paper investigates the characteristics of user behaviors with respect to the online games on the Steam platform. Based on the observations, we argue that a satisfying recommender system for online games is able to characterize: personalization, game contextualization and social connection. However, simultaneously solving all is rather challenging for game recommendation. Firstly, personalization for game recommendation requires the incorporation of the dwelling time of engaged games, which are ignored in existing methods. Secondly, game contextualization should reflect the complex and high-order properties of those relations. Last but not least, it is problematic to use social connections directly for game recommendations due to the massive noise within social connections. To this end, we propose a Social-aware Contextualized Graph Neural Recommender System (SCGRec), which harnesses three perspectives to improve game recommendation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of users' online game behaviors, which motivates the necessity of handling those three characteristics in the online game recommendation."

    "title": "An Approach for Building Efficient and Accurate Social Recommender Systems Using Individual Relationship Networks",
    "abstract": "Social recommender system, using social relation networks as additional input to improve the accuracy of traditional recommender systems, has become an important research topic. However, most existing methods utilize the entire user relationship network with no consideration to its huge size, sparsity, imbalance, and noise issues. This may degrade the efficiency and accuracy of social recommender systems. This study proposes a new approach to manage the complexity of adding social relation networks to recommender systems. Our method first generates an individual relationship network (IRN) for each user and item by developing a novel fitting algorithm of relationship networks to control the relationship propagation and contracting. We then fuse matrix factorization with social regularization and the neighborhood model using IRN's to generate recommendations. Our approach is quite general, and can also be applied to the item-item relationship network by switching the roles of users and items. Experiments on four datasets with different sizes, sparsity levels, and relationship types show that our approach can improve predictive accuracy and gain a better scalability compared with state-of-the-art social recommendation methods."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems leverage user demographic information, such as age, gender, etc., to personalize recommendations and better place their targeted ads. Oftentimes, users do not volunteer this information due to privacy concerns, or due to a lack of initiative in filling out their online profiles. We illustrate a new threat in which a recommender learns private attributes of users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design both passive and active attacks that solicit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. Our methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that such attacks are indeed feasible and use significantly fewer rated items than static inference methods. Importantly, they succeed without sacrificing the quality of recommendations to users."

    "abstract": "Making sense of large graph datasets is a fundamental and challenging process that advances science, education and technology. We survey research on graph exploration and visualization approaches aimed at addressing this challenge. Different from existing surveys, our investigation highlights approaches that have strong potential in handling large graphs, algorithmically, visually, or interactively; we also explicitly connect relevant works from multiple research fields \u2014 data mining, machine learning, human-computer ineraction, information visualization, information retrieval, and recommender systems \u2014 to underline their parallel and complementary contributions to graph sensemaking. We ground our discussion in sensemaking research; we propose a new graph sensemaking hierarchy that categorizes tools and techniques based on how they operate on the graph data (e.g., local vs global). We summarize and compare their strengths and weaknesses, and highlight open challenges. We conclude with future research directions for graph sensemaking."

    "abstract": "Potential conflict of interest: Dr. Hwang received grants from Merck and Gilead. Dr. Chang advises Arbutus. Dr. Lok received grants from Gilead and Bristol\u2010Myers Squibb. Dr. Jonas consults for Gilead and received grants from Bristol\u2010Myers Squibb and Roche. Dr. Brown consults and received grants from Gilead. Dr. Bzowej received grants from Gilead, Allergan and Cirius. Dr. Terrault received grants from Gilead and Bristol\u2010Myers Quibb. Dr. Wong is a member of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This article does not necessarily represent the views and policies of the USPSTF. The funding for the development of this Practice Guidance was provided by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. This practice guidance was approved by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases on December 4, 2017. Purpose and Scope of the Guidance This AASLD 2018 Hepatitis B Guidance is intended to complement the AASLD 2016 Practice Guidelines for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B1 and update the previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) guidelines from 2009. The 2018 updated guidance on chronic hepatitis B (CHB) includes (1) updates on treatment since the 2016 HBV guidelines (notably the use of tenofovir alafenamide) and guidance on (2) screening, counseling, and prevention; (3) specialized virological and serological tests; (4) monitoring of untreated patients; and (5) treatment of hepatitis B in special populations, including persons with viral coinfections, acute hepatitis B, recipients of immunosuppressive therapy, and transplant recipients. The AASLD 2018 Hepatitis B Guidance provides a data\u2010supported approach to screening, prevention, diagnosis, and clinical management of patients with hepatitis B. It differs from the published 2016 AASLD guidelines, which conducted systematic reviews and used a multidisciplinary panel of experts to rate the quality (level) of the evidence and the strength of each recommendation using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system in support of guideline recommendations.1 In contrast, this guidance document was developed by consensus of an expert panel, without formal systematic review or use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The 2018 guidance is based upon the following: (1) formal review and analysis of published literature on the topics; (2) World Health Organization guidance on prevention, care, and treatment of CHB5; and (3) the authors' experience in acute hepatitis B and CHB. Intended for use by health care providers, this guidance identifies preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care for patients with CHB. As with clinical practice guidelines, it provides general guidance to optimize the care of the majority of patients and should not replace clinical judgement for a unique patient. This guidance does not seek to dictate a \"one size fits all\" approach for the management of CHB. Clinical considerations may justify a course of action that differs from this guidance. Interim Data Relevant to the AASLD 2018 Hepatitis B Guidance Since the publication of the 2016 AASLD Hepatitis B Guidelines, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has been approved for treatment of CHB in adults. TAF joins the list of preferred HBV therapies, along with entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and peginterferon (peg\u2010IFN; Tables 1 and 2)6 (section: Updated Recommendations on the Treatment of Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B). Additionally, studies on the use of TDF for prevention of mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission led to TDF being elevated to the level of preferred therapy in this setting (section 1C of Screening, Counseling, and Prevention of Hepatitis B).

TAF, like TDF, is a nucleotide analogue that inhibits reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA to HBV DNA. TAF is more stable than TDF in plasma and delivers the active metabolite to hepatocytes more efficiently, allowing a lower dose to be used with similar antiviral activity, less systemic exposure, and thus decreased renal and bone toxicity. A phase 3 trial of 873 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)\u2010positive patients (26% with past nucleos(t)ide analogue [NA] therapy) randomized to TAF 25 mg daily or TDF 300 mg daily in a 2:1 ratio found similar 48\u2010week responses, with serum HBV DNA <29 IU/mL in 64% versus 67%, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization in 72% versus 67%, HBeAg loss in 14% versus 12%, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss in 1% versus 0.3% in the TAF and TDF groups, respectively.17 Week 96 follow\u2010up results likewise showed that 73% and 75% had serum HBV DNA <29 IU/mL, 22% and 18% lost HBeAg, and 1% and 1% lost HBsAg in TAF and TDF patients, respectively.6 Analogously, a phase 3 trial of 426 HBeAg\u2010negative patients (21% with past NA therapy) randomized to TAF 25 mg daily or TDF 300 mg daily in a 2:1 ratio found comparable 48\u2010week normalization in 83% versus 75% in the TAF and TDF groups, respectively. However, no patient in either group lost HBsAg.18 Week 96 follow\u2010up results also showed serum HBV DNA <29 IU/mL in 90% of TAF patients and 91% of TDF patients, with 1 TAF\u2010treated patient losing HBsAg.7 The approved dose of TAF is 25 mg orally once\u2010daily, with no dose adjustment needed unless creatinine clearance is <15 mL/min. In these phase 3 studies, TAF had significantly less decline than TDF in bone density and renal function at 48 weeks of treatment. In HBeAg\u2010positive patients, the mean decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was \u22120.6 mL/min for TAF patients, whereas the decline was \u22125.4 mL/min in TDF patients (P < .0001). In HBeAg\u2010negative patients, the mean decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was \u22121.8 mL/min in TAF patients, whereas the decline for TDF patients was \u22124.8 mL/min (P = .004).17 In hip and spine bone mineral density measurements, the adjusted percentage difference in spine bone mineral density for TAF versus TDF was 1.88% (95% confidence interval, 1.44\u20102.31; P < .0001) for HBeAg\u2010positive patients and 1.64% (95% confidence interval, 1.01\u20102.27; P < .0001) in HBeAg\u2010negative patients after 48 weeks.17 In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2010infected patients, TAF (N = 300) versus TDF (N = 333) containing antiretroviral therapy (ARVT) for up to 144 weeks also showed that TAF had a less negative impact on bone mineral density and renal biomarkers, with fewer patients on TAF versus TDF developing proximal tubulopathy (0 vs. 4) or requiring treatment discontinuation because of renal complications (0 vs. 12; P < .001).19 While longer\u2010term data in HBV\u2010monoinfected patients are lacking, particularly with respect to the impact on clinical outcomes such as renal disease and fracture risk, the current safety profile of TAF combined with evidence of similar antiviral efficacy led to its inclusion among the preferred HBV therapies for those patients requiring treatment. Most studies of switching from TDF to TAF come from the HIV literature. In studies of up to 96 weeks, a switch to TAF versus continued TDF treatment (as part of an antiretroviral regimen) was associated with improvements in proteinuria, albuminuria, proximal renal tubular function (mostly within the first 24 weeks), and bone mineral density.20 Collectively, these studies suggest that TAF has a better safety profile than TDF and similar antiviral efficacy in studies of up to 2 years' duration. 1 Screening, Counseling, and Prevention of Hepatitis B 1A. SCREENING The presence of HBsAg establishes the diagnosis of hepatitis B. Chronic versus acute infection is defined by the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months. The prevalence of HBsAg varies greatly across countries, with high prevalence of HBsAg\u2010positive persons defined as \u22658%, intermediate as 2% to 7%, and low as <2%.21 In developed countries, the prevalence is higher among those who immigrated from high\u2010 or intermediate\u2010prevalence countries and in those with high\u2010risk behaviors.22 HBV is transmitted by perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure and by close person\u2010to\u2010person contact (presumably by open cuts and sores, especially among children in hyperendemic areas).24 In most countries where HBV is endemic, perinatal transmission remains the most important cause of chronic infection. Perinatal transmission also occurs in nonendemic countries (including the United States), mostly in children of HBV\u2010infected mothers who do not receive appropriate HBV immunoprophylaxis at birth. The majority of children and adults with CHB in the United States are immigrants, have immigrant parents, or became exposed through other close household contacts.26 HBV can survive outside the body for prolonged periods.28 The risk of developing chronic HBV infection after acute exposure ranges from 90% in newborns of HBeAg\u2010positive mothers to 25%\u201030% in infants and children under 5 to less than 5% in adults.29 In addition, immunosuppressed persons are more likely to develop chronic HBV infection after acute infection.34 Table 3 displays those at risk for CHB who should be screened for HBV infection and immunized if seronegative.23 HBsAg and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti\u2010HBs) should be used for screening (Table 4). Alternatively, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti\u2010HBc) can be utilized for screening as long as those who test positive are further tested for both HBsAg and anti\u2010HBs to differentiate current infection from previous HBV exposure. HBV vaccination does not lead to anti\u2010HBc positivity.

Table 4 - Interpretation of Screening Tests for HBV Infection Screening Test Results Interpretation Management Vaccinate? HBsAg Anti\u2010HBc Anti\u2010HBs + + \u2013 Chronic hepatitis B Additional testing and management needed No \u2013 + + Past HBV infection, resolved No further management unless immunocompromised or undergoing chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy No \u2013 + \u2013 Past HBV infection, resolved or false\u2010positive HBV DNA testing if immunocompromised patient Yes, if not from area of intermediate or high endemicity \u2013 \u2013 + Immune No further testing No \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Uninfected and not immune No further testing Yes Some persons may test positive for anti\u2010HBc, but not HBsAg; they may or may not also have anti\u2010HBs, with the prevalence depending on local endemicity or the risk group.37 The finding of isolated anti\u2010HBc (anti\u2010HBc positive but negative for HBsAg and anti\u2010HBs) can occur for a variety of reasons. Among intermediate\u2010 to high\u2010risk populations, the most common reason is previous exposure to HBV infection; the majority of these persons recovered from acute HBV infection earlier in life and anti\u2010HBs titers have waned to undetectable levels, but some had been chronically infected with HBV for decades before clearing HBsAg. In the former case, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cirrhosis attributed to HBV is minimal. In the latter, these persons are still at risk of developing HCC, with an incidence rate that appears to be similar to those with inactive chronic HBV with undetectable HBV\u2010DNA levels.39 These individuals usually have low HBV\u2010DNA levels (20\u2010200 IU/mL, more commonly if they are anti\u2010HBs negative than if they are anti\u2010HBs positive) and are typically born in regions with high prevalence of HBV infection or have HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.37 Much less commonly with new, more specific anti\u2010HBc tests, anti\u2010HBc may be a false\u2010positive test result, particularly in persons from low\u2010prevalence areas with no risk factors for HBV infection. Earlier anti\u2010HBc enzyme immunoassay and radioimmunoassay tests were less specific, more frequently yielding false\u2010positive results.45 Anti\u2010HBc may be the only marker of HBV infection during the window phase of acute hepatitis B; these persons should test positive for anti\u2010HBc immunoglobulin M.37 Last, reports exist of HBsAg mutations leading to false\u2010negative HBsAg results.37 Because of the risk for HBV transmission, screening for anti\u2010HBc occurs routinely in blood donors and, if feasible, in organ donors.37 Since the original anti\u2010HBc studies, the specificity of anti\u2010HBc tests has improved to 99.88% in blood donors and 96.85% in non\u2010HBV medical conditions.46 Individuals with HIV infection or those about to undergo HCV or immunosuppressive therapy are at risk for potential reactivation if they have preexisting HBV and should be screened for anti\u2010HBc.37 The majority of individuals positive for anti\u2010HBc alone do not have detectable HBV DNA,37 especially with older, less specific assays. For anti\u2010HBc\u2013positive individuals, additional tests to detect past or current infection include immunoglobulin M anti\u2010HBc, antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti\u2010HBe), and HBV DNA with a sensitive assay. Detectable HBV DNA documents infectivity, but a negative HBV DNA result does not rule out low levels of HBV DNA. Additionally repeat anti\u2010HBc testing can be performed over time, particularly in blood donors in whom subsequent anti\u2010HBc negativity suggests an initial false\u2010positive result.37 Although reports vary depending on the sensitivity and specificity of the anti\u2010HBc test used and HBV prevalence in the study population, the minority of patients have an anamnestic response to HBV vaccination, with the majority having a primary antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination similar to persons without any HBV seromarkers.23 Thus, vaccination could be considered reasonable for all screening indications in Table 3. Anti\u2010HBc\u2013positive HIV\u2010infected individuals should receive HBV vaccination (ideally when CD4 counts exceed 200/\u03bcL) because most have primary responses to HBV vaccination, with \u223c60% to 80% developing anti\u2010HBs levels \u226510 mIU/mL after 3 or 4 vaccinations.50 Thus, limited data suggest that vaccination may be considered.48 When considering the benefit of using an anti\u2010HBc\u2013positive donor organ with possible occult HBV infection, the harm of hepatitis B transmission must be weighed against the clinical condition of the recipient patient. While persons who are positive for anti\u2010HBc, but negative for HBsAg, are at very low risk of HBV reactivation, the risk can be substantial when chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs are administered singly or in combination (see Screening, Counseling, and Prevention of Hepatitis B, section 6D). Thus, all persons who are positive for anti\u2010HBc (with or without anti\u2010HBs) should be considered potentially at risk for HBV reactivation in this setting. Guidance Statements on Screening for Hepatitis B Infection Screening should be performed using both HBsAg and anti\u2010HBs. Screening is recommended in all persons born in countries with a HBsAg seroprevalence of \u22652%, U.S.\u2010born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with high HBV endemicity (\u22658%), pregnant women, persons needing immunosuppressive therapy, and the at\u2010risk groups listed in Table 3. Anti\u2010HBs\u2013negative screened persons should be vaccinated. Screening for anti\u2010HBc to determine prior exposure is not routinely recommended but is an important test in patients who have HIV infection, who are about to undergo HCV or anticancer and other immunosuppressive therapies or renal dialysis, and in donated blood (or, if feasible, organs) (see Screening, Counseling, and Prevention of Hepatitis B, section 6D). 1B. COUNSELING PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS B, INCLUDING PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OTHERS Patients with chronic HBV infection should be counseled regarding lifestyle modifications and prevention of transmission as well as the importance of lifelong monitoring. No specific dietary measures have been shown to have any effect on the progression of CHB per se, but metabolic syndrome and fatty liver contribute to liver\u2010related morbidity.54 Ingestion of more than 7 drinks of alcohol per week for women and more than 14 drinks per week for men are associated with increased risk of cirrhosis and HCC.56 Studies evaluating the risk of lesser amounts of alcohol intake are sparse,58 but the conservative approach is to recommend abstinence or minimal alcohol ingestion.59 Individuals with CHB should be immunized against hepatitis A if not already immune.61 HBsAg\u2010positive persons should be counseled regarding transmission to others (see Table 5). Because of increased risk of acquiring HBV infection, household members and sexual partners should be vaccinated if they test negative for HBV serological markers. For casual sex partners or steady partners who have not been tested or have not completed the full immunization series, barrier protection methods should be utilized. Transmission of HBV from infected health care workers (HCWs) to patients has been shown to occur in rare instances.62 For persons with CHB who are HCWs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that those who perform exposure\u2010prone procedures should seek counseling and advice from an expert review panel.63 If serum HBV DNA exceeds 1,000 IU/mL, antiviral therapy is recommended, and performance of exposure\u2010prone procedures is permitted if serum HBV DNA is suppressed to <1,000 IU/mL and maintained below that cutoff.63 Since 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice has ruled that it is unlawful for medical and dental schools to exclude applicants who are HBsAg positive. Unless prone to biting, no special arrangements need to be made for HBV\u2010infected children in the community other than practicing universal precautions in daycare centers, schools, sports clubs, and camps.23 Table 5 - Recommendations for Infected Persons Regarding Prevention of Transmission of HBV to Others Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive Should: Have household and sexual contacts vaccinated Use barrier protection during sexual intercourse if partner is not vaccinated or is not naturally immune Not share toothbrushes or razors Not share injection equipment Not share glucose testing equipment Cover open cuts and scratches Clean blood spills with bleach solution Not donate blood, organs, or sperm Children and Adults Who Are HBsAg Positive: Can participate in all activities, including contact sports Should not be excluded from daycare or school participation and should not be isolated from other children Can share food and utensils and kiss others Guidance Statements on Counseling of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive HBsAg\u2010positive persons should be counseled regarding prevention of transmission of HBV to others (Table 5). For HCWs and students who are HBsAg positive: They should not be excluded from training or practice because they have hepatitis B. Only HBsAg\u2010positive HCWs and students whose job requires performance of exposure\u2010prone procedures are recommended to seek counseling and advice from an expert review panel at their institution. They should not perform exposure\u2010prone procedures if their serum HBV\u2010DNA level exceeds 1,000 IU/mL but may resume these procedures if their HBV\u2010DNA level is reduced and maintained below 1,000 IU/mL. Other than practicing universal precautions, no special arrangements are indicated for HBV\u2010infected children in community settings, such as daycare centers, schools, sports clubs, and camps, unless they are prone to biting. Abstinence or only limited use of alcohol is recommended in HBV\u2010infected persons. Optimization of body weight and treatment of metabolic complications, including control of diabetes and dyslipidemia, are recommended to prevent concurrent development of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver. Guidance Statements on Counseling of Persons Who Are HBsAg Negative and anti\u2010HBc Positive (With or Without anti\u2010HBs) Screening for anti\u2010HBc is not routinely recommended except in patients who have HIV infection or who are about to undergo HCV therapy or immunosuppressive treatment. Persons who are anti\u2010HBc positive without HBsAg are not at risk of transmission of HBV, either sexually or to close personal contacts. Persons who are positive only for anti\u2010HBc and who are from an area with low endemicity with no risk factors for HBV should be given the full series of hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who are positive only for anti\u2010HBc and have risk factors for hepatitis B (Table 3) are not recommended for vaccination unless they are HIV positive or immunocompromised. 1C. COUNSELING OF HBsAg\u2010POSITIVE WOMEN IN PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM All pregnant women should be screened for HBsAg. Pregnant women with CHB should be encouraged to discuss with their obstetrician and/or pediatrician the prevention of mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and HBV vaccine should be administered to their newborn <12 hours after delivery.23 Antiviral therapy in the third trimester is recommended for pregnant women with serum HBV DNA >200,000 IU/mL.1 A proportion of women (around 25%) have hepatitis flares with or without HBeAg seroconversion within the first months after delivery.65 Seroconversion rates of up to 17% have been described. It has been postulated that the rapid decrease in cortisol levels characteristic of the postpartum state is analogous to the steroid withdrawal therapy that has been used to elicit seroconversion. Although the flares are often mild and resolve spontaneously, cases of acute liver failure have been described in the peripartum period.66 Extending third trimester antiviral therapy from 2 to 12 weeks postpartum did not protect against postpartum flares in one study,68 supporting the AASLD guideline recommendation that antiviral therapy given for prevention of mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission be discontinued at the time of delivery or up to 4 weeks postpartum.1 A previous systematic review of any antiviral therapy in the third trimester showed a significant reduction in perinatal transmission of HBV4 with lamivudine, telbivudine, or TDF, but TDF is the preferred choice owing to its antiviral potency and concerns for resistance with the other antiviral agents. Two recent randomized, control trials of TDF versus no antiviral treatment in the third trimester confirmed significant reductions in risk of mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission of hepatitis B with TDF in women with a high level of HBV DNA.69 Elevated maternal creatine kinase levels were more frequent in TDF\u2010treated versus untreated women in one study, though none were assessed as clinically significant.69 Both studies found no difference in the rates of prematurity, congenita"

    "abstract": "Online news reading has become a widely popular way to read news articles from news sources around the globe. With the enormous amount of news articles available, users are easily overwhelmed by information of little interest to them. News recommender systems help users manage this flood by recommending articles based on user interests rather than presenting articles in order of their occurrence. We present our research on developing personalized news recommendation system with the help of a popular micro-blogging service, \u201cTwitter.\u201d News articles are ranked based on the popularity of the article identified from Twitter\u2019s public timeline. In addition, users construct profiles based on their interests and news articles are also ranked based on their match to the user profile. By integrating these two approaches, we present a hybrid news recommendation model that recommends interesting news articles to the user based on their popularity as well as their relevance to the user profile."

    "abstract": "The internet presents people with an increasingly bewildering variety of choices. Online consumers have to rely on computerized search tools to find the most preferred option in a reasonable amount of time. Recommender systems address this problem by searching for options based on a model of the user's preferences. We consider example critiquing as a methodology for mixed-initiative recommender systems. In this technique, users volunteer their preferences as critiques on examples. It is thus important to stimulate their preference expression by selecting the proper examples, called suggestions. We describe the look-ahead principle for suggestions and describe several suggestion strategies based on it. We compare them in simulations and, for the first time, report a set of user studies which prove their effectiveness in increasing users' decision accuracy by up to 75%."

    "abstract": "Saccadic (rapid) eye movements are primary means by which humans and non-human primates sample visual information. However, while saccadic decisions are intensively investigated in instrumental contexts where saccades guide subsequent actions, it is largely unknown how they may be influenced by curiosity \u2013 the intrinsic desire to learn. While saccades are sensitive to visual novelty and visual surprise, no study has examined their relation to epistemic curiosity \u2013 interest in symbolic, semantic information. To investigate this question, we tracked the eye movements of human observers while they read trivia questions and, after a brief delay, were visually given the answer. We show that higher curiosity was associated with earlier anticipatory orienting of gaze toward the answer location without changes in other metrics of saccades or fixations, and that these influences were distinct from those produced by variations in confidence and surprise. Across subjects, the enhancement of anticipatory gaze was correlated with measures of trait curiosity from personality questionnaires. Finally, a machine learning algorithm could predict curiosity in a cross-subject manner, relying primarily on statistical features of the gaze position before the answer onset and independently of covariations in confidence or surprise, suggesting potential practical applications for educational technologies, recommender systems and research in cognitive sciences. With this article, we provide full access to the annotated database allowing readers to reproduce the results. Epistemic curiosity produces specific effects on oculomotor anticipation that can be used to read out curiosity states."

    "title": "Factorization Models for Forecasting Student Performance",
    "abstract": "Predicting student performance, one of the tasks in educational data mining, has been taken into account recently [Toscher and Jahrer 2010; Yu et al. 2010; Cetintas et al. 2010; Thai-Nghe et al. 2011]. It was selected as a challenge task for the KDD Cup 2010 [Koedinger et al. 2010]. Concretely, predicting student performance is the task where we would like to know how the students learn (e.g. generally or narrowly), how quickly or slowly they adapt to new problems or if it is possible to infer the knowledge requirements to solve the problems directly from student performance data [Corbett and Anderson 1995; Feng et al. 2009], and eventually, we would like to know whether the students perform the tasks (exercises) correctly (or with some levels of certainty). As discussed in Cen et al. [2006], an improved model for predicting student performance could save millions of hours of students\u2019 time and effort in learning algebra. In that time, students could move to other specific fields of their study or doing other things they enjoy. From educational data mining point of view, an accurate and reliable model in predicting student performance may replace some current standardized tests, and thus, reducing the pressure, time, as well as effort on \u201cteaching and learning for examinations\u201d [Feng et al. 2009; Thai-Nghe et al. 2011]. To address the problem of predicting student performance, many papers have been published but most of them are based on traditional classification/regression techniques [Cen et al. 2006; Feng et al. 2009; Yu et al. 2010; Pardos and Heffernan 2010]. Many other works can be found in Romero et al. [2010]. Recently, [Thai-Nghe et al. 2010; Toscher and Jahrer 2010; Thai-Nghe et al. 2011] have proposed using recommendation techniques, e.g. matrix factorization, for predicting student performance. The authors have shown that predicting student performance can be considered as rating prediction since the student, task, and performance would become user, item, and rating in recommender systems, respectively. We know that learning and problem-solving are complex cognitive and affective processes that are different to shopping and other e-commerce transactions, however, as discussed in Thai-Nghe et al. [2011], the factorization models in recommender systems are implicitly able to encode latent factors of students and tasks (e.g. \u201cslip\u201d and \u201cguess\u201d), and especially in case where we do not have enough meta data about students and tasks (or even we have not enough background knowledge of the domain), this mapping is a reasonable approach."

    "title": "A personalised travel recommender system utilising social network profile and accurate GPS data",
    "abstract": "Recent developments in internet technologies have created a massive demand for online services with the rapidly growing users. Travel recommender systems have been embraced by many researchers due to recent developments and significant requirements in the e-tourism domain. Generating personalised recommendations with minimal interactions is a key challenge and predicting personalised list of locations with the available ratings alone cannot achieve effective recommendations. To address this issue, we develop an intelligent real-time user-specific travel recommender system (IRTUSTRS) through incorporating users' social network profile and current location by exploiting global positioning system (GPS) data for travel recommendation generation. The proposed IRTUSTRS approach helps end users through enhanced travel recommendations with improved accuracy. The experimental evaluation portrays the improved performance of IRTUSTRS over baseline approaches. The presented work helps to understand the performance of recommender systems by utilising online social network profile of users with the current location through the GPS data."

    "abstract": "Internet regulation and 'online harms' are matters of much political and regulatory attention. This debate is beset by issues, including defining 'online harms', respecting freedom of expression, and others. While much of this debate has focused on content hosted by online platforms, comparatively little attention has been paid to the central role of algorithmic personalisation \u2013 or 'recommending' \u2013 by platforms in content dissemination in online environments and the problems to which this contributes. Focusing on recommender systems, i.e. the mechanism by which content is recommended by platforms, provides an alternative regulatory approach that avoids many of the pitfalls with addressing the hosting of content itself. This paper therefore explores motivations and considerations for regulating the use of recommender systems by online platforms. In doing so, this paper establishes a typology of online recommending, sets out various problems and consequences of recommending, and argues that recommending content is not one of the three activities for which information society service providers are afforded liability protections under the E-Commerce Directive. To address the identified problems and fill this legal gap, this paper proposes some principles for future regulation, and discusses approaches to oversight and compliance that could work with these principles."

    "abstract": "With the growing number of competing Web services that provide similar functionality, Quality-of-Service (QoS) prediction is becoming increasingly important for various QoS-aware approaches of Web services. Collaborative filtering (CF), which is among the most successful personalized prediction techniques for recommender systems, has been widely applied to Web service QoS prediction. In addition to using conventional CF techniques, a number of studies extend the CF approach by incorporating additional information about services and users, such as location, time, and other contextual information from the service invocations. There are also some studies that address other challenges in QoS prediction, such as adaptability, credibility, privacy preservation, and so on. In this survey, we summarize and analyze the state-of-the-art CF QoS prediction approaches of Web services and discuss their features and differences. We also present several Web service QoS datasets that have been used as benchmarks for evaluating the predition accuracy and outline some possible future research directions."

    "title": "De-biasing user preference ratings in recommender systems",
    "abstract": "Prior research has shown that online recommendations have significant influence on users\u2019 preference ratings and economic behavior. Specifically, the self-reported preference rating (for a specific consumed item) that is submitted by a user to a recommender system can be affected (i.e., distorted) by the previously observed system\u2019s recommendation. As a result, anchoring (or anchoring-like) biases reflected in user ratings not only provide a distorted view of user preferences but also contaminate inputs of recommender systems, leading to decreased quality of future recommendations. This research explores two approaches to removing anchoring biases from self-reported consumer ratings. The first proposed approach is based on a computational post-hoc de-biasing algorithm that systematically adjusts the user-submitted ratings that are known to be biased. The second approach is a user-interface-driven solution that tries to minimize anchoring biases at rating collection time. Our empirical investigation explicitly demonstrates the impact of biased vs. unbiased ratings on recommender systems\u2019 predictive performance. It also indicates that the post-hoc algorithmic de-biasing approach is very problematic, most likely due to the fact that the anchoring effects can manifest themselves very differently for different users and items. This further emphasizes the importance of proactively avoiding anchoring biases at the time of rating collection. Further, through laboratory experiments, we demonstrate that certain interface designs of recommender systems are more advantageous than others in effectively reducing anchoring biases."

    "abstract": "Service-oriented computing (SOC) enables organizations and individual users to discover openly-accessible capabilities realized as services over the Internet. However, service registries can potentially be very large preventing organizations from discovering services in real-time. In fact, consumers may not be aware of the services that can be of most benefit to them. In our work, we introduce a web service recommender system that proactively discovers and manages web services. This paper focuses on the underlying search and ranking algorithms that enable the recommendations. As an innovation, we have analyzed real, fully-operational web services currently available on the Internet and, as a result, have discovered insights into how real web service messages are defined. Using these general naming tendencies coupled with enhanced syntactical methods, we are able to aggregate services by their messages and accurately suggest candidate services to users as a part of daily routines."

    "title": "MSGD: A Novel Matrix Factorization Approach for Large-Scale Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems on GPUs",
    "abstract": "Real-time accurate recommendation of large-scale recommender systems is a challenging task. Matrix factorization (MF), as one of the most accurate and scalable techniques to predict missing ratings, has become popular in the collaborative filtering (CF) community. Currently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most famous approaches for MF. However, it is non-trivial to parallelize SGD for large-scale CF MF problems due to the dependence on the user and item pair, which can cause parallelization over-writing. To remove the dependence on the user and item pair, we propose a multi-stream SGD (MSGD) approach, for which the update process is theoretically convergent. On that basis, we propose a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) parallelization MSGD (CUMSGD) approach. CUMSGD can obtain high parallelism and scalability on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). On Tesla K20m and K40c GPUs, the experimental results show that CUMSGD outperforms prior works that accelerated MF on shared memory systems, e.g., DSGD, FPSGD, Hogwild!, and CCD++. For large-scale CF problems, we propose multiple GPUs (multi-GPU) CUMSGD (MCUMSGD). The experimental results show that MCUMSGD can improve MSGD performance further. With a K20m GPU card, CUMSGD can be 5-10 times as fast compared with the state-of-the-art approaches on shared memory platform."

To this end, in this paper, we present a new method for a knowledge-graph-based, path-based recommender system for learning activities. The suggested approach makes better learning activity recommendations by using connections between people and/or products. By pre-defining meta-paths or automatically mining connective patterns, our method uses the student-learning activity graph to find path-level commonalities for learning activities. The path-based approach can provide an explanation for the result as well. Our methodology is used in an intelligent tutoring system with Java programming as the domain being taught. The system keeps track of user behavior and can recommend learning activities to students using a knowledge-graph-based recommender system. Numerous metadata, such as kind, complexity, and number of questions, are used to describe each activity. The system has been evaluated with promising results that highlight the effectiveness of the path-based recommendations for learning activities, while preserving the pedagogical affordance."

    "abstract": "We present a new frequency-domain phenomenological model of the gravitational-wave signal from the inspiral, merger and ringdown of non-precessing (aligned-spin) black-hole binaries. The model is calibrated to 19 hybrid effective-one-body--numerical-relativity waveforms up to mass ratios of 1:18 and black-hole spins of $|a/m| \\sim 0.85$ ($0.98$ for equal-mass systems). The inspiral part of the model consists of an extension of frequency-domain post-Newtonian expressions, using higher-order terms fit to the hybrids. The merger-ringdown is based on a phenomenological ansatz that has been significantly improved over previous models. The model exhibits mismatches of typically less than 1\\% against all 19 calibration hybrids, and an additional 29 verification hybrids, which provide strong evidence that, over the calibration region, the model is sufficiently accurate for all relevant gravitational-wave astronomy applications with the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. Beyond the calibration region the model produces physically reasonable results, although we recommend caution in assuming that \\emph{any} merger-ringdown waveform model is accurate outside its calibration region. As an example, we note that an alternative non-precessing model, SEOBNRv2 (calibrated up to spins of only 0.5 for unequal-mass systems), exhibits mismatch errors of up to 10\\% for high spins outside its calibration region. We conclude that waveform models would benefit most from a larger number of numerical-relativity simulations of high-aligned-spin unequal-mass binaries."

As a consequence, massive collections of multimedia objects are now widely available to a large population of users. As the task of browsing such large collections could be daunting, Recommender Systems are being developed to assist users in finding items that match their needs and preferences. In this article, we present a novel approach to recommendation in multimedia browsing systems, based on modeling recommendation as a social choice problem. In social choice theory, a set of voters is called to rank a set of alternatives, and individual rankings are aggregated into a global ranking. In our formulation, the set of voters and the set of alternatives both coincide with the set of objects in the data collection. We first define what constitutes a choice in the browsing domain and then define a mechanism to aggregate individual choices into a global ranking. The result is a framework for computing customized recommendations by originally combining intrinsic features of multimedia objects, past behavior of individual users, and overall behavior of the entire community of users. Recommendations are ranked using an importance ranking algorithm that resembles the well-known PageRank strategy. Experiments conducted on a prototype of the proposed system confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."

    "abstract": "Personalization services in a ubiquitous computing environment\u2014ubiquitous personalization services computing\u2014are expected to emerge in diverse environments. Ubiquitous personalization must address limited computational power of personal devices and potential privacy issues. Such characteristics require managing and maintaining a client-side recommendation model for ubiquitous personalization. To implement the client-side recommendation model, this paper proposes Buying-net, a customer network in ubiquitous shopping spaces. Buying-net is operated in a community, called the Buying-net space, of devices, customers, and services that cooperate together to achieve common goals. The customers connect to the Buying-net space using their own devices that contain software performing tasks of learning the customers' preferences, searching for similar customers for network formation, and generating recommendation lists of items. Buying-net attempts to improve recommendation accuracy with less computational time by focusing on local relationship of customers and newly obtained information. We experimented with such customer networks in the area of multimedia content recommendation and validated that Buying-net outperformed a typical collaborative-filtering-based recommender system on accuracy as well as computational time. This shows that Buying-net has good potential to be a system for ubiquitous shopping."

The 2011 STRAW +10 reviewed advances in understanding of the critical changes in hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013ovarian function that occur before and after the final menstrual period.Methods Scientists from five countries and multiple disciplines evaluated data from cohort studies of midlife women and in the context of chronic illness and endocrine disorders on change in menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers of reproductive aging including antim\u00fcllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count. Modifications were adopted by consensus.Results STRAW +10 simplified bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage \u22123) and the early postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transition (Stage \u22121) and early postmenopause (Stage +1), and recommended application regardless of women's age, ethnicity, body size, or lifestyle characteristics.Conclusions STRAW +10 provides a more comprehensive basis for assessing reproductive aging in research and clinical contexts. Application of the STRAW +10 staging system should improve comparability of studies of midlife women and facilitate clinical decision making.

    "abstract": "The Web has moved, slowly but steadily, from a collection of documents towards a collection of structured data. Knowledge graphs have then emerged as a way of representing the knowledge encoded in such data as well as a tool to reason on them in order to extract new and implicit information. Knowledge graphs are currently used, for example, to explain search results, to explore knowledge spaces, to semantically enrich textual documents, or to feed knowledge-intensive applications such as recommender systems. In this work, we describe how to create and exploit a knowledge graph to supply a hybrid recommendation engine with information that builds on top of a collections of documents describing musical and sound items. Tags and textual descriptions are exploited to extract and link entities to external graphs such as WordNet and DBpedia, which are in turn used to semantically enrich the initial data. By means of the knowledge graph we build, recommendations are computed using a feature combination hybrid approach. Two explicit graph feature mappings are formulated to obtain meaningful item feature representations able to catch the knowledge embedded in the graph. Those content features are further combined with additional collaborative information deriving from implicit user feedback. An extensive evaluation on historical data is performed over two different datasets: a dataset of sounds composed of tags, textual descriptions, and user\u2019s download information gathered from Freesound.org and a dataset of songs that mixes song textual descriptions with tags and user\u2019s listening habits extracted from Songfacts.com and Last.fm, respectively. Results show significant improvements with respect to state-of-the-art collaborative algorithms in both datasets. In addition, we show how the semantic expansion of the initial descriptions helps in achieving much better recommendation quality in terms of aggregated diversity and novelty."

    "title": "Hybrid recommendation by incorporating the sentiment of product reviews",
    "abstract": "Hybrid recommender systems utilize advanced algorithms capable of learning heterogeneous sources of data and generating personalized recommendations for users. The data can range from user preferences (e.g., ratings or reviews) to item content (e.g., description or category). Prior studies in the field of recommender systems have primarily relied on \"ratings\" as the user feedback, when building user profiles or evaluating the quality of the recommendation. While ratings are informative, they may still fail to represent a comprehensive picture of actual user preferences. In contrast, there are other types of feedback data that differently or complementarily represent users and their preferences, including the reviews and the sentiments encapsulated within them. Such data can reveal important parts of a user's profile that are not necessarily correlated with user ratings, and hence, they potentially reflect a different side of the user's profile. In this paper, we propose a novel form of hybrid recommender system, capable of analyzing the reviews and extracting their sentiments that are incorporated into the recommendation process. We used advanced algorithms to generate recommendations for users capable of incorporating additional data, such as the review sentiment. We conducted analyses and showed that sentiments of user reviews are not always highly correlated with the ratings (e.g., in music domain). This might mean that sentiment can be indicative of a different aspect of user preferences and can be used as an alternative signal of user feedback. Hence, we have used both ratings and sentiments of reviews when evaluating our proposed hybrid recommender system. We selected two common datasets for the evaluation, Amazon Digital Music and Amazon Video Games, and showed the superior performance of the proposed hybrid recommender system compared to different baselines. The comparison were made in two evaluation scenarios, namely, when the ratings were considered the user feedback and when sentiments of the review were considered the user feedback."

    "title": "Dynamic Poisson Factorization",
    "abstract": "Models for recommender systems use latent factors to explain the preferences and behaviors of users with respect to a set of items (e.g., movies, books, academic papers). Typically, the latent factors are assumed to be static and, given these factors, the observed pref- erences and behaviors of users are assumed to be generated without order. These assumptions limit the explorative and predictive capabilities of such models, since users' interests and item popularity may evolve over time. To address this, we propose dPF, a dynamic matrix factorization model based on the recent Poisson factorization model for recommendations. dPF models the time evolving latent factors with a Kalman filter and the actions with Poisson distributions. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to infer the latent factors. Finally, we demonstrate dPF on 10 years of user click data from arXiv.org, one of the largest repository of scientific papers and a formidable source of information about the behavior of scientists. Empirically we show performance improvement over both static and, more recently proposed, dynamic recommendation models. We also provide a thorough exploration of the inferred posteriors over the latent variables."

However, such a practice ignores the fact that when fairness is guaranteed to one side, the fairness and rights of the other side are likely to reduce. In this paper, we consider recommendation scenarios from the perspective of two sides (customers and providers). From the perspective of providers, we consider the fairness of the providers' exposure in recommender system. For customers, we consider the fairness of the reduced quality of recommendation results due to the introduction of fairness measures. We theoretically analyzed the relationship between recommendation quality, customers fairness, and provider fairness, and design a two-sided fairness-aware recommendation model (TFROM) for both customers and providers. Specifically, we design two versions of TFROM for offline and online recommendation. The effectiveness of the model is verified on three real-world data sets. The experimental results show that TFROM provides better two-sided fairness while still maintaining a higher level of personalization than the baseline algorithms."

We find that algorithmic control in the workplace operates through six main mechanisms, which we call the \"6 Rs\"\u2014employers can use algorithms to direct workers by restricting and recommending, evaluate workers by recording and rating, and discipline workers by replacing and rewarding. We also discuss several key insights regarding algorithmic control. First, labor process theory helps to highlight potential problems with the largely positive view of algorithms at work. Second, the technical capabilities of algorithmic systems facilitate a form of rational control that is distinct from the technical and bureaucratic control used by employers for the past century. Third, employers' use of algorithms is sparking the development of new algorithmic occupations. Finally, workers are individually and collectively resisting algorithmic control through a set of emerging tactics we call algoactivism.

Our approach was compared to some other metrics used in Information Theoretic approach to illustrate its potential applications."

    "title": "Some assembly required: leveraging Web science to understand and enable team assembly",
    "abstract": "Recent advances on the Web have generated unprecedented opportunities for individuals around the world to assemble into teams. And yet, because of the Web, the nature of teams and how they are assembled has changed radically. Today, many teams are ad hoc, agile, distributed, transient entities that are assembled from a larger primordial network of relationships within virtual communities. These assemblages possess the potential to unleash the high levels of creativity and innovation necessary for productively addressing many of the daunting challenges confronting contemporary society. This article argues that Web science is particularly well suited to help us realize this potential by making a substantial interdisciplinary intellectual investment in (i) advancing theories that explain our socio-technical motivations to form teams, (ii) the development of new analytic methods and models to untangle the unique influences of these motivations on team assembly, (iii) harvesting, curating and leveraging the digital trace data offered by the Web to test our models, and (iv) implementing recommender systems that use insights gleaned from our richer theoretical understanding of the motivations that lead to effective team assembly."

    "title": "Landslides in a changing climate",
    "abstract": "Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate."

    "title": "Predicting lamp spectrum effects at mesopic levels. Part 1: Spatial brightness",
    "abstract": "This paper reports on experimental work carried out to test metrics for predicting spatial brightness at mesopic levels under lamps of different spectral power distribution. The side-by-side matching technique was used following an extensive review of experimental design. Five different types of lamps were presented in all 10 possible pairs, these being selected to compare brightness predictions based on established characteristics of lamp spectrum such as colour rendering index, correlated colour temperature and the scotopic/photopic ratio. The results were also used to test proposed systems for predicting brightness and visual performance at mesopic levels. Of the lamp characteristics examined the scotopic/photopic ratio exhibited the highest correlation with the test results. The new CIE recommended system for visual performance based mesopic photometry was found to give an acceptable prediction of the brightness results."

    "abstract": "While the sue and costs of Management Information Systems (MIS) have become highly visible, little attention has been paid to assessing and communicating system effectiveness. Evaluation of system effectiveness is difficult due to its multidimensionality, its qualitative and quantitative aspects, and the multiple, and often conflicting, evaluator viewpoints.\r\n\r\nThis article provides an overview of what system effectiveness means and how it should be measured. It is the first of two articles to appear in consecutive issues of the MIS Quarterly. Starting with a definition of system effectiveness, this article examines evaluation of system effectiveness in terms of a conceptual hierarchy of system objectives. The hierarchy is used to discuss problems in, and recommendations for, evaluating system effectiveness, and to compare MIS evaluation approaches. The second article characterizes and compares the evaluator viewpoints on system effectiveness for decision makers in several functional groups involved in MIS implementation \u1fa2 user, MIS, internal audit, and management. The second article recommends several MIS evaluation approaches for incorporating multiple dimensions and multiple evaluator viewpoints into evaluations of information system effectiveness."

    "abstract": "On the basis of principle of energy cascade utilization, a reconstruction scheme for eco-industrial park, which adopts diesel engines, absorption chiller, liquid dehumidification process and biogas generation to produce cooling, heating and power, is proposed in this paper. The major component of the recommended system is composed of four sets of diesel engines, which produce electricity for the industrial park. Waste heat from engines, including the heat from the exhaust gas and the heat from jacket cooling water, is utilized for absorption refrigeration and for driving the liquid dehumidification process, respectively. Moreover, the wastewater and biomass energy from the living area are recovered to generate biogas, which could be used as fuel for diesel engines. The analysis indicates a superior performance of the recommended system in energy utilization from the viewpoint of the first law and second law of thermodynamics. The energy utilization coefficient, energy saving ratio of fossil fuel (ESRf) and exergy efficiency of the recommended system are 84, 34 and 36.22%, with 20, 14 and 4.55 percentage points higher than that of the existing system. Compared with the existing system, biogas can replace about 1.5% heavy oil to generate power, whereas the liquid desiccant can provide about 42% cooling duty to replace the electricity consumption by air-conditioners. The recommended system can reduce CO2 emission by about 48% compared with the single product systems. The results achieved in this research demonstrate that energy cascade utilization in CCHP can make a significant contribution to energy saving in the eco-industrial park. Complementary utilization of fossil energy and renewable energy can not only reduce environmental pollution but can also save energy for the eco-industrial park.

    "abstract": "News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them to discover relevant articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift. Some promising results have been recently achieved by the usage of Deep Learning techniques on Recommender Systems, specially for item's feature extraction and for session-based recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks. In this paper, it is proposed an instantiation of the CHAMELEON -- a Deep Learning Meta-Architecture for News Recommender Systems. This architecture is composed of two modules, the first responsible to learn news articles representations, based on their text and metadata, and the second module aimed to provide session-based recommendations using Recurrent Neural Networks. The recommendation task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for users sessions: \"what is the next most likely article a user might read in a session?\" Users sessions context is leveraged by the architecture to provide additional information in such extreme cold-start scenario of news recommendation. Users' behavior and item features are both merged in an hybrid recommendation approach. A temporal offline evaluation method is also proposed as a complementary contribution, for a more realistic evaluation of such task, considering dynamic factors that affect global readership interests like popularity, recency, and seasonality. Experiments with an extensive number of session-based recommendation methods were performed and the proposed instantiation of CHAMELEON meta-architecture obtained a significant relative improvement in top-n accuracy and ranking metrics (10% on Hit Rate and 13% on MRR) over the best benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "Internet is speeding up and modifying the manner in which daily tasks such as online shopping, paying utility bills, watching new movies, communicating, etc., are accomplished. As an example, in older shopping methods, products were mass produced for a single market and audience but that approach is no longer viable. Markets based on long product and development cycles can no longer survive. To stay competitive, markets need to provide different products and services to different customers with different needs. The shift to online shopping has made it incumbent on producers and retailers to customize for customers' needs while providing more options than were possible before. This, however, poses a problem for customers who must now analyze every offering in order to determine what they actually need and will benefit from. To aid customers in this scenario, we discuss about common recommender systems techniques that have been employed and their associated trade-offs."

    "abstract": "The development of the new system for lung allocation in the United States has been a complex and at times controversial process (20Egan TM Kotloff RM. Pro/Con debate: Lung allocation should be based on medical urgency and transplant survival and not on waiting time..Chest. 2005; 128: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lung allocation is no longer based on waiting time; it now balances a measure of waiting list urgency (expected lifetime without a transplant) and a measure of transplant benefit (the difference between expected lifetime with versus without a transplant). The urgency and benefit measures are estimated from clinical measurements and demographic data. When potential recipients' clinical condition changes, their data can be updated and their score will change accordingly. Because the population of patients waiting and the risks of waiting list mortality and posttransplant mortality may change with time, the system is intended to be modified as often as every 6 months, based on analysis of the most recent 3-year cohort of patients. Any new risk factors identified by these analyses can be incorporated into future iterations of the allocation system. In addition to regular reviews, the Lung Subcommittee has recommended that the system be reviewed at a forum with the lung transplant community at a suitable time after implementation for feedback and suggestions for refinement."

    "abstract": "Surveys are popular methods to measure public perceptions in emergencies but can be costly and time consuming. We suggest and evaluate a complementary \"infoveillance\" approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms \"H1N1\" versus \"swine flu\" over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of \"tweets\"; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool.Between May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords \"swine flu,\" \"swineflu,\" and/or \"H1N1.\" using Infovigil, an infoveillance system. Tweets using \"H1N1\" increased from 8.8% to 40.5% (R(2) = .788; p<.001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health Organization-recommended terminology. 5,395 tweets were randomly selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial coding scheme. To track tweet content and to test the feasibility of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and correlated these results with manual coding. Content analysis indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared (52.6%). 4.5% of cases were identified as misinformation. News websites were the most popular sources (23.2%), while government and health agencies were linked only 1.5% of the time. 7/10 automated queries correlated with manual coding. Several Twitter activity peaks coincided with major news stories. Our results correlated well with H1N1 incidence data.This study illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct \"infodemiology\" studies for public health. 2009 H1N1-related tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions and experiences. Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and knowledge translation research, allowing health authorities to respond to public concerns."

    "abstract": "The World Wide Web is a great source of products and services available to people. Scientists have made a huge effort to create effective strategies to personalize those products/services for anyone willing to use them. The personalization may be provided by Recommender Systems which are able to match people's preferences to specific products or services. Scientists from different research areas such as Psychology, Neurology and Affective Computing agree that human reasoning and decision-making are hardly ever affected by psychological aspects. Thus, to maintain the same level of personalized service provided by humans, computers should also ''reason, taking into account users' psychological aspects. Nevertheless, the psychological aspects have, unfortunately, not been highly applied in most models of User Profiles used in Recommender Systems. As a result, the existing Recommender Systems do not actually use psychological aspects such as Personality Traits during their decision-making process in order to generate their recommendations. In this thesis we propose the implementation of the Personality Traits in User Profiles so it is possible to obtain evidence that the use of Personality Traits in Recommender Systems might be coherent and effective for the improvement of the recommendations for users and, therefore, act proactively towards users' needs, offering more adaptable products and services according to their future needs."

We propose Outside-The-Box (otb) recommendation, which takes some risk to help users make fresh discoveries, while maintaining high relevance. The proposed formalization relies on item regions and attempts to identify regions that are under-exposed to the user. We develop a recommendation algorithm which achieves a compromise between relevance and risk to find otb items. We evaluate this approach on the MovieLens data set and compare our otb recommendations against conventional recommendation strategies."

    "abstract": "Immune support by micronutrients is historically based on vitamin C deficiency and supplementation in scurvy in early times. It has since been established that the complex, integrated immune system needs multiple specific micronutrients, including vitamins A, D, C, E, B6, and B12, folate, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium, which play vital, often synergistic roles at every stage of the immune response. Adequate amounts are essential to ensure the proper function of physical barriers and immune cells; however, daily micronutrient intakes necessary to support immune function may be higher than current recommended dietary allowances. Certain populations have inadequate dietary micronutrient intakes, and situations with increased requirements (e.g., infection, stress, and pollution) further decrease stores within the body. Several micronutrients may be deficient, and even marginal deficiency may impair immunity. Although contradictory data exist, available evidence indicates that supplementation with multiple micronutrients with immune-supporting roles may modulate immune function and reduce the risk of infection. Micronutrients with the strongest evidence for immune support are vitamins C and D and zinc. Better design of human clinical studies addressing dosage and combinations of micronutrients in different populations are required to substantiate the benefits of micronutrient supplementation against infection."

    "title": "A Clustering Approach for Personalizing Diversity in Collaborative Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Much of the focus of recommender systems research has been on the accurate prediction of users' ratings for unseen items. Recent work has suggested that objectives such as diversity and novelty in recommendations are also important factors in the effectiveness of a recommender system. However, methods that attempt to increase diversity of recommendation lists for all users without considering each user's preference or tolerance for diversity may lead to monotony for some users and to poor recommendations for others. Our goal in this research is to evaluate the hypothesis that users' propensity towards diversity varies greatly and that the diversity of recommendation lists should be consistent with the level of user interest in diverse recommendations. We propose a pre-filtering clustering approach to group users with similar levels of tolerance for diversity. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a method for personalizing diversity by performing collaborative filtering independently on different segments of users based on the degree of diversity in their profiles. Secondly, we investigate the accuracy-diversity tradeoffs using the proposed method across different user segments. As part of this evaluation we propose new metrics, adapted from information retrieval, that help us measure the effectiveness of our approach in personalizing diversity. Our experimental evaluation is based on two different datasets: MovieLens movie ratings, and Yelp restaurant reviews."

The performance of this kind of system depends on a large amount of information. At the same time, the amount of information on the Web is continuously growing, especially due to increased User Generated Content since the apparition of Web 2.0. In this paper, we propose a method that exploits blog textual data in order to supply a recommender system. The method we propose has two steps. First, subjective texts are labelled according to their expressed opinion in order to build a user-item-rating matrix.

In this article we compare two approaches: the relevancy assessment from the user survey and the relevancy detection with statistical testing on the rating data. With these approaches we want to see if it is possible for users to predict which context inuences their decisions and which approach leads to better detection of the relevant contextual information."

The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies' ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat."

At the same time, with the expansion of social media, it is now easier than ever to form groups of people. As such, group recommenders have become more popular. Often, we consider the interaction between a group and the recommender system as a stand-alone process; the group requests some suggestions from the system and the system answers without any considerations to past interactions. A more realistic scenario is for a system to require access to history logs, and take them into account when recommending items for a group of users. Not only what items the system previously had recommended, but also, how well were these items received by the members of the group. In this work, we propose a sequential group recommender, which is aware of the past interactions of the group with the system. We introduce the notion of satisfaction that describes how relevant are the recommended items to each member of the group. We utilize satisfaction in a novel aggregation method that achieves to make our model fair for all members of the group. We show with experimental results that the typical group recommendation approaches are substandard to our proposed method."

    "abstract": "To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients.A multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. In addition, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, which classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) based on factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence.The task force coined the term critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that occurs during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency together with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents, particularly in the setting of sepsis. At this time, the diagnosis of tissue corticosteroid resistance remains problematic. Adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients is best made by a delta total serum cortisol of < 9 microg/dL after adrenocorticotrophic hormone (250 microg) administration or a random total cortisol of < 10 microg/dL. The benefit of treatment with glucocorticoids at this time seems to be limited to patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock and patients with early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 of < 200 and within 14 days of onset). The adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test should not be used to identify those patients with septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome who should receive glucocorticoids. Hydrocortisone in a dose of 200 mg/day in four divided doses or as a continuous infusion in a dose of 240 mg/day (10 mg/hr) for > or = 7 days is recommended for septic shock. Methylprednisolone in a dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for > or = 14 days is recommended in patients with severe early acute respiratory distress syndrome. Glucocorticoids should be weaned and not stopped abruptly. Reinstitution of treatment should be considered with recurrence of signs of sepsis, hypotension, or worsening oxygenation. Dexamethasone is not recommended to treat critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. The role of glucocorticoids in the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, liver failure, pancreatitis, those undergoing cardiac surgery, and other groups of critically ill patients requires further investigation.Evidence-linked consensus statements with regard to the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid deficiency in critically ill patients have been developed by a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force."

    "title": "Robust Transfer Learning for Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering Using Multiple Rating Patterns Approximation",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering techniques are a common approach for building recommendations, and have been widely applied in real recommender systems. However, collaborative filtering usually suffers from limited performance due to the sparsity of user-item interaction. To address this issue, auxiliary information is usually used to improve the performance. Transfer learning provides the key idea of using knowledge from auxiliary domains. An assumption of transfer learning in collaborative filtering is that the source domain is a full rating matrix, which may not hold in many real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage rating patterns from multiple incomplete source domains to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the transferred learning, we compress the knowledge from the source domain into a cluster-level rating matrix. The rating patterns in the low-level matrix can be transferred to the target domain. Specifically, we design a knowledge extraction method to enrich rating patterns by relaxing the full rating restriction on the source domain. Finally, we propose a robust multiple-rating-pattern transfer learning model for cross-domain collaborative filtering, which is called MINDTL, to accurately predict missing values in the target domain. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and outperforms several alternative methods."

    "title": "National Performance Benchmarks for Modern Screening Digital Mammography: Update from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium",
    "abstract": "Purpose To establish performance benchmarks for modern screening digital mammography and assess performance trends over time in U.S. community practice. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013approved study measured the performance of digital screening mammography interpreted by 359 radiologists across 95 facilities in six Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries. The study included 1 682 504 digital screening mammograms performed between 2007 and 2013 in 792 808 women. Performance measures were calculated according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, 5th edition, and were compared with published benchmarks by the BCSC, the National Mammography Database, and performance recommendations by expert opinion. Benchmarks were derived from the distribution of performance metrics across radiologists and were presented as 50th (median), 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, with graphic presentations using smoothed curves. Results Mean screening performance measures were as follows: abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), 11.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.5, 11.6); cancers detected per 1000 screens, or cancer detection rate (CDR), 5.1 (95% CI: 5.0, 5.2); sensitivity, 86.9% (95% CI: 86.3%, 87.6%); specificity, 88.9% (95% CI: 88.8%, 88.9%); false-negative rate per 1000 screens, 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8); positive predictive value (PPV) 1, 4.4% (95% CI: 4.3%, 4.5%); PPV2, 25.6% (95% CI: 25.1%, 26.1%); PPV3, 28.6% (95% CI: 28.0%, 29.3%); cancers stage 0 or 1, 76.9%; minimal cancers, 57.7%; and node-negative invasive cancers, 79.4%. Recommended CDRs were achieved by 92.1% of radiologists in community practice, and 97.1% achieved recommended ranges for sensitivity. Only 59.0% of radiologists achieved recommended AIRs, and only 63.0% achieved recommended levels of specificity. Conclusion The majority of radiologists in the BCSC surpass cancer detection recommendations for screening mammography; however, AIRs continue to be higher than the recommended rate for almost half of radiologists interpreting screening mammograms. \u00a9 RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

    "title": "Point-of-Interest Recommender Systems: A Separate-Space Perspective",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Location-based Social Network (LBSN) services, a large number of Point-Of-Interests (POIs) have been available, which consequently raises a great demand of building personalized POI recommender systems. A personalized POI recommender system can significantly assist users to find their preferred POIs and help POI owners to attract more customers. However, it is very challenging to develop a personalized POI recommender system because a user's checkin decision making process is very complex and could be influenced by many factors such as social network and geographical distance. In the literature, a variety of methods have been proposed to tackle this problem. Most of these methods model user's preference for POIs with integrated approaches and consider all candidate POIs as a whole space. However, by carefully examining a longitudinal real-world checkin data, we find that the whole space of users' checkins actually consists of two parts: social friend space and user interest space. The social friend space denotes the set of POI candidates that users' friends have checked-in before and the user interest space refers to the set of POI candidates that are similar to users' historical checkins, but are not visited by their friends yet. Along this line, we develop separate models for the both spaces to recommend POIs. Specifically, in social friend space, we assume users would repeat their friends' historical POIs due to the preference propagation through social networks, and propose a new Social Friend Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (SFPMF) model. In user interest space, we propose a new User Interest Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (UIPMF) model to capture the correlations between a new POI and one user's historical POIs. To evaluate the proposed models, we conduct extensive experiments with many state-of-the-art baseline methods and evaluation metrics on the real-world data set. The experimental results firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models."

    "title": "International Consensus on Standardization of Data Collection for Complications Associated With Esophagectomy",
    "abstract": "In Brief Introduction: Perioperative complications influence long- and short-term outcomes after esophagectomy. The absence of a standardized system for defining and recording complications and quality measures after esophageal resection has meant that there is wide variation in evaluating their impact on these outcomes. Methods: The Esophageal Complications Consensus Group comprised 21 high-volume esophageal surgeons from 14 countries, supported by all the major thoracic and upper gastrointestinal professional societies. Delphi surveys and group meetings were used to achieve a consensus on standardized methods for defining complications and quality measures that could be collected in institutional databases and national audits. Results: A standardized list of complications was created to provide a template for recording individual complications associated with esophagectomy. Where possible, these were linked to preexisting international definitions. A Delphi survey facilitated production of specific definitions for anastomotic leak, conduit necrosis, chyle leak, and recurrent nerve palsy. An additional Delphi survey documented consensus regarding critical quality parameters recommended for routine inclusion in databases. These quality parameters were documentation on mortality, comorbidities, completeness of data collection, blood transfusion, grading of complication severity, changes in level of care, discharge location, and readmission rates. Conclusions: The proposed system for defining and recording perioperative complications associated with esophagectomy provides an infrastructure to standardize international data collection and facilitate future comparative studies and quality improvement projects. Complications affect every major outcome parameter after major cancer surgery. No internationally accepted system for documenting complications after esophagectomy currently exists. Using the Delphi process, high-volume esophageal surgeons from 14 countries have reached a consensus on a standardized list of complications, quality measures, and definitions for specific complications."

    "abstract": "Older persons are often poorly served by existing models of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). We sought input from clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers on recommendations for system improvements.Focus group interviews were held with clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers in mid-sized urban and rural communities in Ontario. Data were analyzed using a combination of directed and emergent coding. Results were shared with participants during a series of feedback sessions.An extensive list of barriers, facilitators, and recommended health system improvements was generated. Barriers included poor system integration and limited access to services. Identified facilitators were person and family-focused care, self-management resources, and successful collaborative practice. Recommended system improvements included expanding and integrating care teams, supports for system navigation, and development of standardized information systems and care pathways.Older adults still experience frustrating obstacles when trying to access CBPHC. Identified barriers and facilitators of improved system integration aligned well with current literature and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Additional work is needed to implement the recommended improvements and to discern their impact on patient and system outcomes."

    "title": "Deep Modeling of Group Preferences for Group-Based Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, most recommender systems (RSs) mainly aim to suggest appropriate items for individuals. Due to the social nature of human beings, group activities have become an integral part of our daily life, thus motivating the study on group RS (GRS). However, most existing methods used by GRS make recommendations through aggregating individual ratings or individual predictive results rather than considering the collective features that govern user choices made within a group. As a result, such methods are heavily sensitive to data, hence they often fail to learn group preferences when the data are slightly inconsistent with predefined aggregation assumptions. To this end, we devise a novel GRS approach which accommodates both individual choices and group decisions in a joint model. More specifically, we propose a deep-architecture model built with collective deep belief networks and dual-wing restricted Boltzmann machines. With such a deep model, we can use high-level features, which are induced from lower-level features, to represent group preference so as to relieve the vulnerability of data. Finally, the experiments conducted on a real-world dataset prove the superiority of our deep model over other state-of-the-art methods."

    "title": "A BERT-Based Multi-Criteria Recommender System for Hotel Promotion Management",
    "abstract": "Numerous reviews are posted every day on travel information sharing platforms and sites. Hotels want to develop a customer recommender system to quickly and effectively identify potential target customers. TripAdvisor, the travel website that provided the data used in this study, allows customers to rate the hotel based on six criteria: Value, Service, Location, Room, Cleanliness, and Sleep Quality. Existing studies classify reviews into positive, negative, and neutral by extracting sentiment terms through simple sentimental analysis. However, this method has limitations in that it does not consider various aspects of hotels well. Therefore, this study performs fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model using review data with rating labels on the TripAdvisor site. This study suggests a multi-criteria recommender system to recommend a suitable target customers for the hotel. As the rating values of six criteria of TripAdvisor are insufficient, the proposed recommender system uses fine-tuned BERT to predict six criteria ratings. Based on this predicted ratings, a multi-criteria recommender system recommends personalized Top-N customers for each hotel. The performance of the multi-criteria recommender system suggested in this study is better than that of the benchmark system, a single-criteria recommender system using overall ratings."

    "title": "FedAttack: Effective and Covert Poisoning Attack on Federated Recommendation via Hard Sampling",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a feasible technique to learn personalized recommendation models from decentralized user data. Unfortunately, federated recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious clients. Existing recommender system poisoning methods mainly focus on promoting the recommendation chances of target items due to financial incentives. In fact, in real-world scenarios, the attacker may also attempt to degrade the overall performance of recommender systems. However, existing general FL poisoning methods for degrading model performance are either ineffective or not concealed in poisoning federated recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and covert poisoning attack method on federated recommendation, named FedAttack. Its core idea is using globally hardest samples to subvert model training. More specifically, the malicious clients first infer user embeddings based on local user profiles. Next, they choose the candidate items that are most relevant to the user embeddings as hardest negative samples, and find the candidates farthest from the user embeddings as hardest positive samples. The model gradients inferred from these poisoned samples are then uploaded for aggregation. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FedAttack can effectively degrade the performance of various federated recommender systems, meanwhile cannot be effectively detected nor defended by many existing methods."

    "title": "Recommendation Unlearning",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems provide essential web services by learning users' personal preferences from collected data. However, in many cases, systems also need to forget some training data. From the perspective of privacy, users desire a tool to erase the impacts of their sensitive data from the trained models. From the perspective of utility, if a system's utility is damaged by some bad data, the system needs to forget such data to regain utility. While unlearning is very important, it has not been well-considered in existing recommender systems. Although there are some researches have studied the problem of machine unlearning, existing methods can not be directly applied to recommendation as they are unable to consider the collaborative information."

    "abstract": "We propose a new recommendation algorithm for online documents, images and videos, which is personalized. Our idea is to rely on the attention time of individual users captured through commodity eye-tracking as the essential clue. The prediction of user interest over a certain online item (a document, image or video) is based on the user's attention time acquired using vision-based commodity eye-tracking during his previous reading, browsing or video watching sessions over the same type of online materials. After acquiring a user's attention times over a collection of online materials, our algorithm can predict the user's probable attention time over a new online item through data mining. Based on our proposed algorithm, we have developed a new online content recommender system for documents, images and videos. The recommendation results produced by our algorithm are evaluated by comparing with those manually labeled by users as well as by commercial search engines including Google (Web) Search, Google Image Search and YouTube."

    "title": "Text Data Management and Analysis: A Practical Introduction to Information Retrieval and Text Mining",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media (such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets). This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people manage and analyze vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and capture semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to management and analysis of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic. This book provides a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. Because humans can understand natural languages far better than computers can, effective involvement of humans in a text information system is generally needed and text information systems often serve as intelligent assistants for humans. Depending on how a text information system collaborates with humans, we distinguish two kinds of text information systems. The first is information retrieval systems which include search engines and recommender systems; they assist users in finding from a large collection of text data the most relevant text data that are actually needed for solving a specific application problem, thus effecively turning big raw text data into much smaller relevant text data that can be more easily processed by humans. The second is text mining application systems; they can assist users in analyzing patterns in text data to extract and discover useful actionable knowledge directly useful for task completion or decision making, thus providing more direct task support for users. This book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in information retrieval and text data mining from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of information retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, library and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in managing and analyzing text data."

    "abstract": "A study has been made to determine the accuracy of the trypan blue staining technique as an index of the proportion of viable cells in a cell population. Eosin and acridine orange were also tested in preliminary studies but were found to be relatively toxic. Cell cultures in vitro and tumor cell populations tested in vivo are used for direct comparisons between viability values obtained by staining cell populations with trypan blue, and values obtained by testing the growth potential of the same cell populations under optical conditions of cultivation. Data are included relative to the effects of trauma, freezing, and of various dispersal agents upon cell viability. The results indicate correlation but not absolute agreement between the two methods (staining and cultivation). Trypan blue values are shown to be 85% (or better) of cultivability values under optimal conditions of handling, but they are grossly inaccurate and unpredictable following traumatic treatment of cell populations. Before trypan blue staining is accepted as an index of cell viability, it is recommended that the specific system under study first be carefully defined."

    "title": "Hepatitis C Guidance 2019 Update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases\u2013Infectious Diseases Society of America Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C Virus Infection",
    "abstract": "The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) initiated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance project (hereafter HCV guidance) in 2013. The AASLD-IDSA HCV guidance website (www.HCVGuidelines.org) disseminates up-to-date, peer-reviewed, unbiased, evidence-based recommendations to aid clinicians making decisions regarding the testing, management, and treatment of HCV infection. Using a web-based system enables timely and nimble distribution of the HCV guidance, which is periodically updated in near real time as necessitated by emerging research data, recommendations from public health agencies, the availability of therapeutic agents, or other significant developments affecting the rapidly evolving hepatitis C arena. The value and utility of the online HCV guidance to the community of hepatitis C care providers throughout the world is evidence by the nearly 10 million pageviews by 1.5 million users originating from 228 countries and territories since the January 2014 launch of the website. A major update of the HCV guidance was released electronically in November 2019. This HCV guidance update summarizes and highlights key new or amended recommendations since the previous October 2018 print publication.1 The advent of safe, well-tolerated, and highly efficacious (>95% cure rate)2 direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV infection has ushered in an era in which elimination of hepatitis C is conceivable. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a global health sector strategy to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030 and developed an action plan to facilitate this goal.3 In response to the WHO action plan, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) developed a US strategy for the elimination of hepatitis C.4 Key elements of the elimination plan include improved detection of undiagnosed cases, increased linkage and access to care for newly diagnosed persons, and expanded treatment access. Many of the recommendations included in the latest update to the HCV guidance and highlighted herein align with and support the goals of the NASEM and WHO strategies to move from control to eventual elimination of hepatitis C. Topics addressed include universal and risk-based hepatitis C screening, simplified treatment algorithms for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, hepatitis C management in the pediatric population, acute hepatitis C testing and management, and transplantation of organs from HCV-viremic donors into HCV-negative recipients. For detailed evidence reviews related to these topics and information addressing other aspects of HCV testing and management, see the online HCV guidance (www.HCVGuidelines.org). The HCV guidance was developed and is updated by a volunteer panel (representing the AASLD and the IDSA) of hepatology and infectious diseases clinicians with hepatitis C expertise using an evidence-based review of available data, including information presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Based on scientific evidence and expert opinion, recommendations are rated by the level of evidence (I, II, or III) and the strength of the recommendation (A, B, or C) using a system adapted from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.5, 6 See the original AASLD\u2013IDSA hepatitis C guidance publication7 or the HCV guidance website for additional details about the processes and methods employed. All recommendations are reviewed and approved by the governing boards of the AASLD and the IDSA. The HCV guidance panel classifies therapeutic regimens as recommended, alternative, or not recommended based on patient factors (i.e., treatment-naive versus experienced, cirrhosis status, and comorbidities) and viral characteristics (i.e., genotype, subtype, resistance-associated substitutions). Recommended regimens are considered equivalent; alternative regimens are effective but, compared to recommended regimens, have potential disadvantages, limitations for use in certain patient populations, or less supporting data. The identification of risk factors associated with contracting HCV infection served as the basis for the risk-based hepatitis C screening recommendations issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1998.8 Although sensitive for the identification of persons with chronic HCV infection, risk-based screening failed to identify the majority of individuals with HCV infection due to both clinician and patient barriers.9-12 Analysis of the 2003-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey prevalence data demonstrated that approximately three fourths of individuals with chronic hepatitis C in the United States belonged to the 1945-1965 birth cohort.13 Based on these data, both the CDC and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended one-time hepatitis C screening of all individuals in this birth cohort (1945-1965) regardless of risk factors.14, 15 Since these recommendations were established in 2012, HCV epidemiology in the United States has changed. Hepatitis C infection incidence nearly quadrupled from 2010 to 2017, primarily driven by increased injection drug use related to the opioid epidemic.16-19 CDC viral hepatitis surveillance data indicate progressively increasing acute HCV infection incidence each year from 2009 through 2017. Most of these new HCV infections occurred in persons born after 1965, with those aged 20-39 years accounting for the majority of cases. This ongoing trend has spurred interest in expanding HCV screening among the general US population. Several modeling studies suggest the cost-effectiveness of such an approach.20-23 Accordingly, the AASLD\u2013IDSA guidance HCV screening and follow-up recommendations have been updated and include recommended universal HCV screening for all adults aged 18 years or older followed by periodic testing for persons with ongoing risk behaviors and/or exposures. In light of the inadequacy of targeted HCV case finding using risk-based and birth cohort HCV screening,24, 25 investigators have modeled the cost-effectiveness of one-time universal HCV screening for adults aged \u2265 18 years. Independent studies using different modeling techniques demonstrate that one-time universal screening for adults aged \u2265 18 years is cost-effective (<$30,000/quality-adjusted life-years) compared with birth-cohort screening.20, 26 Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of nontargeted HCV screening has proven robust in a variety of venues including correctional,27 prenatal,28, 29 and primary care30 settings as well as substance use treatment centers.31, 32 Given the current epidemiology of HCV disease in the United States, the cost-effectiveness of universal HCV screening, the high efficacy of DAA therapy, and the myriad liver-related and other health benefits of virologic cure,33-38 the HCV guidance panel recommends universal, one-time, opt-out HCV screening of adults aged \u2265 18 years. Although neither the CDC nor the USPSTF currently recommend universal HCV screening in adults, the CDC initiated a peer review process to consider such a recommendation in July 2019. Similarly, in August 2019, the USPSTF published a draft recommendation for universal HCV screening among adults aged 18-79 years. The USPSTF draft universal hepatitis C screening recommendation differs from that of the AASLD\u2013IDSA HCV guidance by setting an upper age limit of 79 years. The HCV guidance panel does not recommend an age limit for universal adult HCV screening due to the excellent quality of life of many octogenarians and the association between advanced age and more rapid HCV disease progression. The HCV guidance panel's new universal screening recommendation is intended to enhance HCV case finding among adults not included in the 1945-1965 birth cohort and aligns with the WHO and NASEM goals of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030. This is particularly important for men and women aged 20-39 years due to the disproportionate overlapping impact of the opioid epidemic and associated injection drug use and the rising rate of incident HCV infections in this age group. Universal HCV screening also bypasses the inherent barriers in ascertaining an accurate risk factor assessment. One-time, risk-based HCV screening is recommended for persons younger than 18 years old with current or past behaviors, exposures, or conditions or circumstances associated with an increased risk of HCV infection (see Table 1). There is currently insufficient evidence to support universal HCV screening in the pediatric population. People with an ongoing risk factor(s) for HCV infection remain vulnerable for as long as the behavior, exposure, condition, or circumstance persists, thereby warranting periodic repeat HCV testing. There is a paucity of data addressing the optimal frequency of repeat testing, thereby leaving the periodicity to the clinician's discretion on a case-by-case basis with consideration of an individual's risk for HCV infection or reinfection. People who inject drugs (PWID) and men with HIV infection who have unprotected sex with men are exceptions to this guidance. Because of the high incidence and prevalence of HCV infection in these populations,39-47 at least annual HCV testing is recommended. Given that many PWID lack access to or eschew traditional health care\u2013delivery systems, integration of HCV testing services into substance use treatment programs, needle/syringe service programs, and acute detoxification programs expands the opportunities to accomplish periodic HCV testing in this key population.48-50 HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended for initial HCV screening.51, 52 The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test (OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test; OraSure Technologies Inc., Bethlehem, PA) are similar to laboratory-based assays.53, 54 A positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection (acute or chronic), a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result.55 A test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection (see Fig. 1). Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. This approach requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing, a major barrier in the continuum of care.56 Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing. Dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture, and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this an advantageous testing option in rural areas and among people for whom phlebotomy is a testing barrier.57 An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay with a detection level of \u226425 IU/mL should be used. HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance because HCV-antibody positivity is expected (see Fig. 1). Immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody\u2013negative due to delayed or failed seroconversion58 or being in the seroconversion window period,52 respectively. HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals, particularly for those with a known risk factor(s). Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection. Although additional testing is typically unnecessary, HCV-RNA testing can be repeated for persons with ongoing HCV infection risk or if there is a high index of suspicion for recent infection. If either the clinician or the patient wishes to determine whether a positive HCV-antibody test in the absence of HCV viremia represents a resolved HCV infection or a biologic false positive, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken. A false positive typically does not occur with two different assays.51, 59 Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiating antiviral therapy to determine baseline viremia (viral load), which may affect treatment duration with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir therapy. With the advent of pangenotypic DAA regimens, HCV genotyping is no longer universally required prior to treatment initiation. Pretreatment genotyping is recommended for persons with a prior HCV treatment failure because DAA regimen selection and duration may differ by genotype. Pretreatment genotyping is not required for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis if a pangenotypic regimen is used. Upon diagnosis of active HCV infection, patients require counseling and certain clinical interventions prior to initiation of antiviral therapy. Prevention of further liver damage is crucial. To that end, counseling patients to abstain from alcohol takes priority because of associations between excess alcohol use and incident or progressive fibrosis and the development of HCC.60-69 There is no known safe level of alcohol use for patients with chronic hepatitis C. All patients with chronic hepatitis C, especially those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, should be advised to abstain from alcohol use.70-72 Persons suffering from alcohol use disorder require treatment for this condition; consider referring these individuals to an addiction specialist. Ongoing alcohol use, however, is not a contraindication to antiviral therapy. Data indicate that ongoing alcohol use does not affect therapeutic outcomes with DAA regimens among treatment-adherent patients.73 From a public health perspective, educating persons with HCV infection about how to avoid transmitting the virus to others (Table 2) serves as an essential primary prevention measure to curb and eventually eliminate the hepatitis C epidemic. Exposure to infected blood is the primary mode of HCV transmission. Epidemics of acute HCV due to sexual transmission in men with HIV infection who have sex with men have also been described.74-77 Persons should be counseled to stop using illicit drugs and enter substance abuse treatment. Those who continue to inject drugs should be counseled to: Assessing liver disease severity is an essential component of the workup for all persons with newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis C as this factor influences initial and follow-up evaluation. This assessment (i.e., presence or absence of cirrhosis) can usually be accomplished with noninvasive tests (Table 3). Liver biopsy is rarely required but is a consideration if other causes of liver disease are suspected. Persons with known or suspected cirrhosis are at increased risk for complications of advanced liver disease and require frequent follow-up. They should also avoid hepatotoxic drugs, such as excessive acetaminophen (>2 g/day) and certain herbal supplements. Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should also be avoided. Ongoing imaging surveillance for HCC and gastroesophageal varices is recommended for patients with cirrhosis.78-80 Cirrhosis with portal hypertension portends a greater likelihood of developing future hepatic complications in untreated patients.81, 82 Transient elastography provides point-of-care information regarding liver stiffness and can reliably distinguish patients with a high versus low likelihood of cirrhosis.83-85 Screening for HBV with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and HIV with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended because these coinfections are associated with a poorer HCV prognosis.86-90 Persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk.91 Anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed.92 Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed. The CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.93 Chronic HCV infection is an important infectious cause of death in the United States and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality from viral hepatitis globally. The availability of safe, effective, well-tolerated therapy substantially facilitates the goal of expanding HCV treatment as recommended in the HCV elimination strategies of the WHO3 and the NASEM.4 Overall, DAA regimens successfully cure HCV infection in > 95% of treated persons.2 Moreover, the development of coformulated, pangenotypic regimens that require relatively short treatment durations has greatly simplified HCV antiviral therapy administration. Despite these remarkable therapeutic improvements, in 2015, only 7.4% of persons with diagnosed HCV had begun antiviral treatment.94 Although more recent limited data indicate increased DAA access and uptake, this has been uneven geographically and across different patient populations.95-97 Thus, only a minority of persons with HCV infection obtain the many health benefits of successful treatment. From a public health perspective, successful HCV treatment also supports primary prevention by decreasing the population of persons capable of transmitting the virus, thereby reducing the incidence of HCV infection. Eradicating hepatitis C infection results in numerous health benefits, including reduced rates of all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC.33, 37, 98-110 Successful treatment also confers improvement in extrahepatic manifestations of HCV disease, including cryoglobulinemic vasculitis111-116 and HCV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders,117-125 as well as improved productivity and quality of life.34, 35, 126-131 Given these and other benefits associated with virologic cure, the HCV guidance panel strongly recommends antiviral treatment for all adults with acute or chronic HCV infection (except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated). Importantly, this recommendation includes persons with ongoing substance use (alcohol or drugs). Several studies demonstrate that treatment-committed individuals in this disproportionately affected population achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) rates with DAA therapy comparable to those without known, current substance use.73, 132-139 The universal treatment recommendation represents a principal tenet of the HCV guidance along with newly recommended universal hepatitis C screening of adults. The HCV guidance panel urges health care providers caring for adults to encourage hepatitis C screening and treatment (if positive) because DAA therapy is safe and cures HCV infection in most people.2 One approach to improving access to curative HCV treatment is expanding the number of health care providers administering antiviral therapy. Data demonstrate that HCV treatment can be effectively provided by a broad range of health care professionals with differing expertise\u2014including specialists, primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, clinical pharmacy specialists, physician assistants, and registered nurses\u2014without compromising treatment efficacy or safety.95, 140 Consequently, the HCV guidance panel developed simplified HCV treatment algorithms for treatment-naive adults (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis), which align with the NASEM plan to eliminate HCV as a US public health burden by 2030. These simplified treatment algorithms are designed to be used by any health care provider knowledgeable about HCV disease and treatment, including those without extensive experience who have timely access to a specialist. The simplified treatment algorithms provide concise, clear guidance on pretreatment assessment, on-treatment monitoring, assessment of response, and posttreatment management (see Figs. 2 and 3). The simplified HCV treatment algorithm for adults without cirrhosis (see Fig. 2) applies to persons aged \u2265 18 years who have not been previously treated for their infection and do not have evidence of cirrhosis as defined by the noninvasive parameters specified in the HCV guidance. Evidence of cirrhosis includes a FIB-4 score > 3.25 or any of the following findings from a previously performed test: transient elastography indicating cirrhosis (e.g., FibroScan [Echosens, Paris, France] stiffness > 12.5 kPa), noninvasive serologic tests that exceed proprietary cutoffs (e.g., FibroSure [BioPredictive, Paris, France], Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test [Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany], etc.), clinical evidence of cirrhosis (e.g., liver nodularity and/or splenomegaly on imaging, platelet count < 150,000/mm3, etc.), and/or prior liver biopsy showing cirrhosis. This simplified treatment algorithm is not recommended for persons with HIV and/or HBV infection, prior liver transplantation, HCC, end-stage renal disease (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/m2), and/or current pregnancy because they require more nuanced care. See the online HCV guidance for management and treatment recommendations for these patients. The pretreatment evaluation should include an assessment for cirrhosis, medication reconciliation, drug\u2013drug interactions, and patient education regarding treatment administration and the importance of adherence and transmission prevention. Recommended pretreatment laboratory testing is conducted to confirm chronic HCV infection and exclude decompensated liver disease, HBV and/or HIV coinfection, end-stage renal disease, and pregnancy prior to treatment initiation. Clearance of HCV infection with DAA therapy can improve hepatic function and thereby affect the safety and efficacy of some concomitantly administered medications. Real-world data indicate an association between DAA therapy and reduced glycemia, particularly among people with diabetes.141-144 Patients taking diabetes medication(s) should be informed of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia during and after DAA therapy. Glucose monitoring during and after DAA treatment is recommended; dosage adjustments of diabetes medication(s) may be needed. Real-world data also indicate an association between DAA therapy and a clinically significant reduction in warfarin dose response.145, 146 Patients taking warfarin should be informed of the potential for a change in their anticoagulation status. International normalized ratio (INR) monitoring for subtherapeutic anticoagulation is recommended during and after DAA treatment; warfarin dosage adjustments may be needed. For others, on-treatment laboratory monitoring is not required unless a patient experiences treatment-related side effects or there are adherence concerns. Several well-designed, robust clinical trials have demonstrated the safety147 and high curative efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir148-158 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir159-164 among treatment-naive persons without cirrhosis regardless of HCV genotype. These findings have been confirmed in real-world cohort studies for both glecaprevir/pibrentasvir165-167 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.167-171 Based on these data, 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm. To assess treatment response, HCV-RNA and hepatic aminotransferase testing is recommended 12 or more weeks after completing DAA treatment. Undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure. In the absence of cirrhosis, persons who attain SVR require no liver-specific follow-up. For those with ongoing HCV risk factors, risk-reduction counseling is recommended as well as HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse (i.e., reemergence of the originally infecting HCV strain).172, 173 With reinfection, treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure. Persons who attain SVR but have persistently elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels require evaluation for other causes of liver disease. Individuals for whom treatment fails can often be successfully retreated; see the online HCV guidance for management and antiviral regimen recommendations for treatment-experienced persons. If retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6-12 months is recommended, as specified in Fig. 2. Advise all patients, regardless of SVR, to avoid excess alcohol intake to prevent liver damage. The simplified HCV treatment algorithm for adults with compensated cirrhosis (see Fig. 3) applies to persons aged \u2265 18 years who have not been previously treated for their infection and have evidence of compensated cirrhosis (i.e., Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) but not decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., CTP class B or C). Noninvasive evidence of cirrhosis mirrors the parameters specified in the previous section and are shown in Fig. 3. Calculation of the CTP score is recommended to differentiate compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis. A CTP score \u2265 7 or any history of decompensation disqualifies these patients for the simplified treatment algorithm. Recommended pretreatment assessment also includes clinical evaluation for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy and ultrasound imaging of the liver within the prior 6 months to evaluate for HCC and subclinical ascites; any of these clinical or imaging findings are contraindications to use of the simplified treatment algorithm. See the online HCV guidance for treatment and management of persons with decompensated cirrhosis. Other circumstances and comorbid conditions that disqualify a patient for use of the simplified treatment algorithm mirror those described in the previous section and are shown in Fig. 3. Similarly, medication reconciliation, assessment for potential drug\u2013drug interactions, and pretreatment education and counseling are the same as for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis (see Fig. 3). Pretreatment laboratory assessment of patients with compensated cirrhosis eligible for use of the simplified treatment algorithm includes complete blood count (CBC), INR, a hepatic function panel, and eGFR within 3 months of initiating antiviral therapy. Quantitative HCV-RNA, HIV-antigen/antibody, and HBsAg tests are recommended any time prior to initiating DAA therapy. Notably, pretreatment genotype testing is recommended if sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy is planned because of the necessity for baseline RAS testing in persons with cirrhosis and genotype 3 infection. Because new-onset hepatic decompensation develops rarely during HCV DAA treatment, clinicians may opt for on-treatment blood tests to detect liver injury. Patients who experience deteriorating hepatic laboratory parameters and/or new-onset jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, or other new liver-related signs or symptoms should promptly see a liver specialist. On-treatment monitoring of blood glucose levels and INR are recommended for persons on diabetes medications or warfarin, respectively, with dosage adjustments as warranted (see previous section for a more detailed discussion). Multiple rigorous clinical trials have demonstrated the safety139 and high curative efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir148, 174-177 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir160, 162-164, 171, 178-180 among treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of HCV genotype. These findings have been confirmed in real-world cohort studies for both glecaprevir/pibrentasvir153, 165-167, 181-183 and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.169, 170, 184-189 Based on these data, recommended regimens for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm are 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for patients with genotype 1-6 or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for those with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Pretreatment RAS testing is recommended for persons with genotype 3 because only those without a baseline NS5A Y93H RAS are eligible for a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Patients with genotype 3 and a baseline Y93H RAS should be treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or an alternative regimen (see the online HCV guidance). HCV-RNA and aminotransferase testing are recommended 12 or more weeks after completion of DAA therapy to assess treatment response. Undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure. Ultrasound surveillance for HCC (with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing) every 6 months after treatment completion is recommended for patients with cirrhosis, regardless of achieving SVR.78 Upper endoscopic surveillance for esophageal varices is recommended, consistent with AASLD guidance on portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis.190 Advise all patients to abstain from alcohol use to reduce the risk of liver disease progression. Risk-reduction counseling is recommended for persons with ongoing HCV risk factors. HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs is also recommended for these persons. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse.172, 173 With reinfection, the treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment.

    "title": "Bayesian Data Mining in Large Frequency Tables, with an Application to the FDA Spontaneous Reporting System",
    "abstract": "Abstract A common data mining task is the search for associations in large databases. Here we consider the search for \"interestingly large\" counts in a large frequency table, having millions of cells, most of which have an observed frequency of 0 or 1. We first construct a baseline or null hypothesis expected frequency for each cell, and then suggest and compare screening criteria for ranking the cell deviations of observed from expected count. A criterion based on the results of fitting an empirical Bayes model to the cell counts is recommended. An example compares these criteria for searching the FDA Spontaneous Reporting System database maintained by the Division of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology. In the example, each cell count is the number of reports combining one of 1,398 drugs with one of 952 adverse events (total of cell counts = 4.9 million), and the problem is to screen the drug-event combinations for possible further investigation."

    "title": "C2PS: A Digital Twin Architecture Reference Model for the Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems",
    "abstract": "Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in the Internet-of-Things related research works, where physical systems act as the sensors to collect real-world information and communicate them to the computation modules (i.e. cyber layer), which further analyze and notify the findings to the corresponding physical systems through a feedback loop. Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems. Later, we present a telematics-based prototype driving assistance application for the vehicular domain of C2PS, VCPS, to demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture reference model."

    "title": "Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "We propose a Joint Neural Collaborative Filtering (J-NCF) method for recommender systems. The J-NCF model applies a joint neural network that couples deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling with a rating matrix. Deep feature learning extracts feature representations of users and items with a deep learning architecture based on a user-item rating matrix. Deep interaction modeling captures non-linear user-item interactions with a deep neural network using the feature representations generated by the deep feature learning process as input. J-NCF enables the deep feature learning and deep interaction modeling processes to optimize each other through joint training, which leads to improved recommendation performance. In addition, we design a new loss function for optimization that takes both implicit and explicit feedback, point-wise and pair-wise loss into account. Experiments on several real-world datasets show significant improvements of J-NCF over state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of up to 8.24% on the MovieLens 100K dataset, 10.81% on the MovieLens 1M dataset, and 10.21% on the Amazon Movies dataset in terms of HR@10. NDCG@10 improvements are 12.42%, 14.24%, and 15.06%, respectively. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the scalability and sensitivity of J-NCF. Our experiments show that the J-NCF model has a competitive recommendation performance with inactive users and different degrees of data sparsity when compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

    "title": "Private context-aware recommendation of points of interest: An initial investigation",
    "abstract": "Several context-aware mobile recommender systems have been recently proposed to suggest points of interest (POIs). Ideally, a user of these systems should not be allowed to know the preferred POIs of another user, since they reveal sensitive information like political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Unfortunately, existing POI recommender systems do not provide any formal guarantee of privacy. In this paper, we report an initial investigation of this challenging research issue. We propose the use of differential privacy methods to extract statistics about users' preferences for POIs. Actual recommendations are generated by querying those statistics, in order to formally enforce privacy. We also present a high-level architecture to apply our methods."

    "title": "Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "The sequential recommendation, which models sequential behavioral patterns among users for the recommendation, plays a critical role in recommender systems. However, the state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) solutions rarely consider the non-linear feature interactions and non-monotone short-term sequential patterns, which are essential for user behavior modeling in sparse sequence data. In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network model (RCNN). It not only utilizes the recurrent architecture of RNN to capture complex long-term dependencies, but also leverages the convolutional operation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract short-term sequential patterns among recurrent hidden states. Specifically, we first generate a hidden state at each time step with the recurrent layer. Then the recent hidden states are regarded as an \u201cimage\u201d, and RCNN searches non-linear feature interactions and non-monotone local patterns via intra-step horizontal and inter-step vertical convolutional filters, respectively. Moreover, the output of convolutional filters and the hidden state are concatenated and fed into a fully-connected layer to generate the recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model using four real-world datasets from various application scenarios. The experimental results show that our model RCNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on sequential recommendation."

Our model provides an explanation for the findings of Nguyen, et. al (2014), where, in environments where recommender systems are typically deployed, users consume increasingly similar items over time even without recommendation. We find that recommendation alleviates these natural filter-bubble effects, but that it also leads to an increase in homogeneity across users, resulting in a trade-off between homogenizing across-user consumption and diversifying within-user consumption. Finally, we discuss how our model highlights the importance of collecting data on user beliefs and their evolution over time both to design better recommendations and to further understand their impact."

    "abstract": "Social network studies are becoming increasingly popular and have been applied to several fields of study such as law enforcement, marketing, spread of disease, as well as in the improvement of organizational performance. One area that is yet to be explored relates to harnessing the power of social networks as recommender systems. The idea that users may provide other users with recommendations that are more relevant than naive approaches is long known. However, the approaches currently implemented are based on the creation of simple relationships such as co-purchase of similar items. Similarly, video websites would like to suggest related videos to users to maximize the time they spend on their sites. Ergo it is crucial that sites like YouTube provide users with recommendations that are relevant to them. Moreover, given the large amount of videos on YouTube, a good recommender system may alleviate users' efforts on finding videos that interest them the most. Existing recommender systems for YouTube are typically based on finding similarities between the videos' textual features (video title or tags annotations) and matching these features to tags in the user's profiles or the videos they are currently watching. This approach is very limited because it restricts the users interests to the current theme of the video being played or the preferences in their profiles. This means that if one is watching a movie about football, it is assumed that the user would like recommendations on other videos about football. In this paper, we attempt to extract information about video relationship using a network formed from reviews left as comments in YouTube videos. We create a network of videos called YouTube Recommender Network (YRN) and use complex network analysis on this network as the basis of a recommender system. Our results show that our list of recommended videos is more diverse than the ones based on textual information. Our YRN provides diversity and captures other important characteristics such as high rating and most-viewed count."

    "abstract": "Trust has been explored by many researchers in the past as a successful solution for assisting recommender systems. Even though the approach of using a web-of-trust scheme for assisting the recommendation production is well adopted, issues like the sparsity problem have not been explored adequately so far with regard to this. In this work we are proposing and testing a scheme that uses the existing ratings of users to calculate the hypothetical trust that might exist between them. The purpose is to demonstrate how some basic social networking when applied to an existing system can help in alleviating problems of traditional recommender system schemes. Interestingly, such schemes are also alleviating the cold start problem from which mainly new users are suffering. In order to show how good the system is in that respect, we measure the performance at various times as the system evolves and we also contrast the solution with existing approaches. Finally, we present the results which justify that such schemes undoubtedly work better than a system that makes no use of trust at all."

The Conference receives contributions from many traditional as well as hot topics in the field, ranging from Multimodal Interfaces and Recommender Systems, to Affective Computing and Brain-Computing Interfaces. Because of this ever-increasing diversity of topics, this edition has seen further changes to our reviewing process. We have introduced a rebuttal phase for Long Papers, following a trend adopted by several high-quality conferences. The objective of the rebuttal is to ensure greater transparency and fairness, as the authors' responses should influence the discussion phase moderated by a Senior Program Committee (SPC) member. In order to ensure that all topics were adequately covered over 200 reviewers have contributed to the selection of this year's program and we trust that this had a very positive impact on the relevance and quality of individual reviews. We have retained the successful format of the conference with Long Papers, Short Papers and Demonstrations. In addition, we have addressed the issue of conversion of Long Papers into Short Papers by explicitly requesting authors' approval at submission time. The accepted submissions cover a wide range of topics, including personalized information systems, intelligent user interaction for information search and browsing, affective computing, gesture-based systems, and multimodal user interfaces. Geographically, the accepted work also represents researchers and institutions in many countries across four continents, including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. As always, the selection process has been the object of careful consideration and multiple discussions. We have asked the SPC moderators to formulate recommendations for acceptance and in the vast majority of cases it has been straightforward for us to endorse their choice. It is always down to the Program Chairs to make final decisions, sometimes difficult ones, on the total number of papers to be accepted. We have adopted a continuity policy from previous editions (around 22% for Long Papers), this year's overall acceptance rate achieves the right balance between selectivity and openness to innovative papers. The conference program highlights two invited talks: Paul Sajda, from Columbia University and Kazuo Yano, from Hitachi's Advanced Research Laboratory. This year's Conference will also feature five full-day and one half-day workshops, covering several hot topics in the area of IUI, with strong emphasis on semantics, social aspects and multimodality of interfaces, including: Social Recommender Systems Intelligent Visual Interfaces for Text Analysis Multimodal Interfaces for Automotive Applications Interoperability and Interaction on the Social and Semantic Web Eye Gaze in Intelligent Human Machine Interaction Semantic Models for Adaptive Interactive Systems The demonstration program accepted fifteen regular submissions.

    "abstract": "Since coronavirus has shown up, inaccessibility of legitimate clinical resources is at its peak, like the shortage of specialists, healthcare workers, lack of proper equipment and medicines. The entire medical fraternity is in distress, which results in numerous individuals demise. Due to unavailability, people started taking medication independently without appropriate consultation, making the health condition worse than usual. As of late, machine learning has been valuable in numerous applications, and there is an increase in innovative work for automation. This paper intends to present a drug recommender system that can drastically reduce specialists heap. In this research, we build a medicine recommendation system that uses patient reviews to predict the sentiment using various vectorization processes like Bow, TFIDF, Word2Vec, and Manual Feature Analysis, which can help recommend the top drug for a given disease by different classification algorithms. The predicted sentiments were evaluated by precision, recall, f1score, accuracy, and AUC score. The results show that classifier LinearSVC using TFIDF vectorization outperforms all other models with 93% accuracy."

    "title": "Shilling Attack Detection in Recommender Systems via Selecting Patterns Analysis",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) has been widely used in recommender systems to generate personalized recommendations. However, recommender systems using CF are vulnerable to shilling attacks, in which attackers inject fake profiles to manipulate recommendation results. Thus, shilling attacks pose a threat to the credibility of recommender systems. Previous studies mainly derive features from characteristics of item ratings in user profiles to detect attackers, but the methods suffer from low accuracy when attackers adopt new rating patterns. To overcome this drawback, we derive features from properties of item popularity in user profiles, which are determined by users' different selecting patterns. This feature extraction method is based on the prior knowledge that attackers select items to rate with man-made rules while normal users do this according to their inner preferences. Then, machine learning classification approaches are exploited to make use of these features to detect and remove attackers. Experiment results on the MovieLens dataset and Amazon review dataset show that our proposed method improves detection performance. In addition, the results justify the practical value of features derived from selecting patterns."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates recommendation fairness among new items. While previous efforts have studied fairness in recommender systems and shown success in improving fairness, they mainly focus on scenarios where unfairness arises due to biased prior user-feedback history (like clicks or views). Yet, it is unknown whether new items without any feedback history can be recommended fairly, and if unfairness does exist, how can we provide fair recommendations among these new items in such a cold-start scenario. In detail, we first formalize fairness among new items with the well-known concepts of equal opportunity and Rawlsian Max-Min fairness. We empirically show the prevalence of unfairness in cold start recommender systems. Then we propose a novel learnable post-processing framework as a model blueprint for enhancing fairness, with which we propose two concrete models: a joint-learning generative model, and a score scaling model. Extensive experiments over four public datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed models for enhancing fairness while also preserving recommendation utility."

    "abstract": "Today's competitive marketplace requires the industry to understand unique and particular needs of their customers. Product line practices enable companies to create individual products for every customer by providing an interdependent set of features. Users configure personalized products by consecutively selecting desired features based on their individual needs. However, as most features are interdependent, users must understand the impact of their gradual selections in order to make valid decisions. Thus, especially when dealing with large feature models, specialized assistance is needed to guide the users in configuring their product. Recently, recommender systems have proved to be an appropriate mean to assist users in finding information and making decisions. In this paper, we propose an advanced feature recommender system that provides personalized recommendations to users. In detail, we offer four main contributions: (i) We provide a recommender system that suggests relevant features to ease the decision-making process. (ii) Based on this system, we provide visual support to users that guides them through the decision-making process and allows them to focus on valid and relevant parts of the configuration space. (iii) We provide an interactive open-source configurator tool encompassing all those features. (iv) In order to demonstrate the performance of our approach, we compare three different recommender algorithms in two real case studies derived from business experience."

    "abstract": "Establishing linkages between Meteorological and climatic data, and farming decision-making is a challenging task. The following paper addresses the challenges associated with this. A large amount of weather and climate information is presently available for farmers. A portion of the information is operational or already under development, and in particular, forecasting through climatic data and formation may not be suitable for farmers when it comes to the decision-making process. The best way to gain an advantage from natural factors is to consider them during decision-making and understand them in the best way possible. Meteorological information pertaining to agriculture, and climatic data, in particular, is an important aspect of planning in the context of agricultural production. Therefore, climatic conditions must be an integral part of the decision-making process. These factors can be determined by recording hourly, daily, and weekly temperature data, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, evaporation, relative humidity, and evapotranspiration. Artificial Neural Networks possess the capability of not just analysing the data but also learning from the data. This paper presents a predictive analysis to analyse the best crop which can be produced for specific weather conditions and also suggests a hybrid recommender system that adopts CBR - Case-Based Reasoning for enhancing the success ratio of the system. This proposed novel hybrid system is a combination of the collaborative filtering technique and case-based reasoning.The novelty of the model lies in the of district-wise agriculture data analysis for predicting future climatic conditions and recommending crops based on that climatic conditions and also considering the agriculture pattern of the district using a hybrid recommender system."

    "title": "An approach to social recommendation for context-aware mobile services",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, several location-based services (LBSs) allow their users to take advantage of information from the Web about points of interest (POIs) such as cultural events or restaurants. To the best of our knowledge, however, none of these provides information taking into account user preferences, or other elements, in addition to location, that contribute to define the context of use. The provided suggestions do not consider, for example, time, day of week, weather, user activity or means of transport. This article describes a social recommender system able to identify user preferences and information needs, thus suggesting personalized recommendations related to POIs in the surroundings of the user's current location. The proposed approach achieves the following goals: (i) to supply, unlike the current LBSs, a methodology for identifying user preferences and needs to be used in the information filtering process; (ii) to exploit the ever-growing amount of information from social networking, user reviews, and local search Web sites; (iii) to establish procedures for defining the context of use to be employed in the recommendation of POIs with low effort. The flexibility of the architecture is such that our approach can be easily extended to any category of POI. Experimental tests carried out on real users enabled us to quantify the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement."

Recommender systems rely on relevance scores for individual content items; in particular, pattern-based recommendation exploits co-occurrences of items in user sessions to ground any guesses about relevancy. To enhance the discovered patterns' quality, the authors propose using metadata about the content that they assume is stored in a domain ontology. Their approach comprises a dedicated pattern space built on top of the ontology, navigation primitives, mining methods, and recommendation techniques."

Since then, some methods have been improved, procedures have been modified, and new substances have been proposed as chemical actinometers. An actinometer is a chemical system or a physical device by which the number of photons in a beam absorbed into the defined space of a chemical reactor can be determined integrally or per time. This compilation includes chemical actinometers for the gas, solid, microheterogeneous, and liquid phases, as well as for the use with pulsed lasers for the measurement of transient absorbances, including the quantum yield of phototransformation, as well as the literature for each of the actinometers. The actinometers listed are for the use in the wavelength range from the UV to the red region of the spectrum. A set of recommended standard procedures is also given. Advantages and disadvantages are discussed regarding the use of chemical actinometers vs. electronic devices for the measurement of the number of photons absorbed. Procedures for the absolute measurement of incident photon flux by means of photodiodes are also discussed."

    "title": "Personalized Privacy-Preserving Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Privacy leakage is an important issue for social recommendation. Existing privacy preserving social recommendation approaches usually allow the recommender to fully control users' information. This may be problematic since the recommender itself may be untrusted, leading to serious privacy leakage. Besides, building social relationships requires sharing interests as well as other private information, which may lead to more privacy leakage. Although sometimes users are allowed to hide their sensitive private data using privacy settings, the data being shared can still be abused by the adversaries to infer sensitive private information. Supporting social recommendation with least privacy leakage to untrusted recommender and other users (i.e., friends) is an important yet challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to address the problem of achieving privacy-preserving social recommendation under personalized privacy settings. We propose PrivSR, a novel framework for privacy-preserving social recommendation, in which users can model ratings and social relationships privately. Meanwhile, by allocating different noise magnitudes to personalized sensitive and non-sensitive ratings, we can protect users' privacy against the untrusted recommender and friends. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can protect users' privacy while being able to retain effectiveness of the underlying recommender system."

    "title": "Graph Heterogeneous Multi-Relational Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Traditional studies on recommender systems usually leverage only one type of user behaviors (the optimization target, such as purchase), despite the fact that users also generate a large number of various types of interaction data (e.g., view, click, add-to-cart, etc). Generally, these heterogeneous multi-relational data provide well-structured information and can be used for high-quality recommendation. Early efforts towards leveraging these heterogeneous data fail to capture the high-hop structure of user-item interactions, which are unable to make full use of them and may only achieve constrained recommendation performance. In this work, we propose a new multi-relational recommendation model named Graph Heterogeneous Collaborative Filtering (GHCF). To explore the high-hop heterogeneous user-item interactions, we take the advantages of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and further improve it to jointly embed both representations of nodes (users and items) and relations for multi-relational prediction. Moreover, to fully utilize the whole heterogeneous data, we perform the advanced efficient non-sampling optimization under a multi-task learning framework. Experimental results on two public benchmarks show that GHCF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, especially for cold-start users who have few primary item interactions. Further analysis verifies the importance of the proposed embedding propagation for modelling high-hop heterogeneous user-item interactions, showing the rationality and effectiveness of GHCF. Our implementation has been released (https://github.com/chenchongthu/GHCF)."

    "title": "Probabilistic group recommendation via information matching",
    "abstract": "Increasingly, web recommender systems face scenarios where they need to serve suggestions to groups of users; for example, when families share e-commerce or movie rental web accounts. Research to date in this domain has proposed two approaches: computing recommendations for the group by merging any members' ratings into a single profile, or computing ranked recommendations for each individual that are then merged via a range of heuristics. In doing so, none of the past approaches reason on the preferences that arise in individuals when they are members of a group. In this work, we present a probabilistic framework, based on the notion of information matching, for group recommendation. This model defines group relevance as a combination of the item's relevance to each user as an individual and as a member of the group; it can then seamlessly incorporate any group recommendation strategy in order to rank items for a set of individuals. We evaluate the model's efficacy at generating recommendations for both single individuals and groups using the MovieLens and MoviePilot data sets. In both cases, we compare our results with baselines and state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms, and show that the model outperforms all others over a variety of ranking metrics."

    "abstract": "For years, E-learning systems are around to provide students and learners with virtual educational environments in which they have no need to others' assistance in the process of learning. From technical point of view, the major goal of such systems is to improve education and learning levels of users through leveraging the system's facilities. In this regard, it is essential for the system to be able to analyze users' functions and behaviors to prepare them with most appropriate learning materials. In other words, the core component of a working and efficient e-learning system is its recommender system. Since requirements and processes of any recommender system strongly depends on the context, users' behaviors and case-specific goals, in most of situations they should be designed exclusively. Due to this fact, in this paper we present a hybrid and context-specific recommender system (CodERS) for our interactive programming e-learning system, CodeLearnr, and provide an overview on its features including conceptual architecture, workflow and sample outputs."

Some of the most popular machine learning algorithms used in movie recommender systems such as K-means clustering, principal component analysis, and self-organizing maps with principal component analysis are discussed in detail. Special emphasis is given to research works performed using metaheuristic-based recommendation systems. The research aims to bring to light the advances made in developing the movie recommender systems, and what needs to be performed to reduce the current challenges in implementing the feasible solutions.

When more and more web services are published online, this technique can also help recommend and select services which satisfy users' particular Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering based service ranking mechanism, in which the invocation and query histories are used to infer the user behavior, and user similarity is calculated based on similar invocations and queries. To overcome some of the inherent problems with the collaborative filtering systems such as the cold start and data sparsity problem, the final ranking score is a combination of the QoS-based matching score and the collaborative filtering based score. The experiment using a simulated dataset proves the effectiveness of the algorithm."

    "abstract": "A recommender system supports customers to find information, products, or services (such as music, books, movies, web sites, and digital contents), so it could help customers to make rapid routine decisions and save their time and money. However, most existing recommender systems do not recommend items that are already purchased by the target customer, so are not suitable for considering customers\u2019 repetitive purchase behavior or purchasing order. In this research, we suggest a multi-period product recommender system, which can learn customers\u2019 purchasing order and customers\u2019 repetitive purchase pattern. For such a purpose we applied the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is one of the artificial neural network structures specialized in time series data analysis, instead of collaborative filtering techniques. Recommendation periods are segmented as various time-steps, and the proposed RNN-based recommender system can recommend items by multiple periods in a time sequence. Several experiments with real online food market data show that the proposed system shows higher performance in accuracy and diversity in a multi-period perspective than the collaborative filtering-based system. From the experimental results, we conclude that the proposed system is suitable for multi-period product recommendation, which results in robust performance considering well customers\u2019 purchasing orders and customers\u2019 repetitive purchase patterns. Moreover, in terms of sustainability, we expect that our study contributes to the reduction of food wastes by inducing planned consumption, and the reduction of shopping time and effort."

    "title": "Enabling Kernel-Based Attribute-Aware Matrix Factorization for Rating Prediction",
    "abstract": "In recommender systems, one key task is to predict the personalized rating of a user to a new item and then return the new items having the top predicted ratings to the user. Recommender systems usually apply collaborative filtering techniques (e.g., matrix factorization) over a sparse user-item rating matrix to make rating prediction. However, the collaborative filtering techniques are severely affected by the data sparsity of the underlying user-item rating matrix and often confront the cold-start problems for new items and users. Since the attributes of items and social links between users become increasingly accessible in the Internet, this paper exploits the rich attributes of items and social links of users to alleviate the rating sparsity effect and tackle the cold-start problems. Specifically, we first propose a Kernel-based Attribute-aware Matrix Factorization model called KAMF to integrate the attribute information of items into matrix factorization. KAMF can discover the nonlinear interactions among attributes, users, and items, which mitigate the rating sparsity effect and deal with the cold-start problem for new items by nature. Further, we extend KAMF to address the cold-start problem for new users by utilizing the social links between users. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for KAMF using two large-scale real-world data sets recently released in Yelp and MovieLens. Experimental results show that KAMF achieves significantly superior performance against other state-of-the-art rating prediction techniques."

    "title": "Attentive Recurrent Social Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering(CF) is one of the most popular techniques for building recommender systems. To alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF, social recommendation has emerged by leveraging social influence among users for better recommendation performance. In these systems, users' preferences over time are determined by their temporal dynamic interests as well as the general static interests. In the meantime, the complex interplay between users' internal interests and the social influence from the social network drives the evolution of users' preferences over time. Nevertheless, traditional approaches either neglected the social network structure for temporal recommendation or assumed a static social influence strength for static social recommendation. Thus, the problem of how to leverage social influence to enhance temporal social recommendation performance remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we present an attentive recurrent network based approach for temporal social recommendation. In the proposed approach, we model users' complex dynamic and general static preferences over time by fusing social influence among users with two attention networks. Specifically, in the dynamic preference modeling process, we design a dynamic social aware recurrent neural network to capture users' complex latent interests over time, where a temporal attention network is proposed to learn the temporal social influence over time. In the general static preference modeling process, we characterize each user's static interest by introducing a static social attention network to model the stationary social influence among users. The output of the dynamic preferences and the static preferences are combined together in a unified end-to-end framework for the temporal social recommendation task. Finally, experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the superiority of our proposed model compared to the baselines."

    "abstract": "An adaptive system for the automatic processing of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the classification of heartbeats into one of the five beat classes recommended by ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998 standard is presented. The heartbeat classification system processes an incoming recording with a global-classifier to produce the first set of beat annotations. An expert then validates and if necessary corrects a fraction of the beats of the recording. The system then adapts by first training a local-classifier using the newly annotated beats and combines this with the global-classifier to produce an adapted classification system. The adapted system is then used to update beat annotations. The results of this study show that the performance of a patient adaptable classifier increases with the amount of training of the system on the local record. Crucially, the performance of the system can be significantly boosted with a small amount of adaptation even when all beats used for adaptation are from a single class. This study illustrates the ability to provide highly beneficial automatic arrhythmia monitoring and is an improvement on previously reported results for automated heartbeat classification systems"

    "title": "On the stability of recommendation algorithms",
    "abstract": "The paper introduces stability as a new measure of the recommender systems performance. In general, we define a recommendation algorithm to be \"stable\" if its predictions for the same items are consistent over a period of time, assuming that any new ratings that have been submitted to the recommender system over the same period of time are in complete agreement with system's prior predictions. In this paper, we advocate that stability should be a desired property of recommendation algorithms, because unstable recommendations can lead to user confusion and, therefore, reduce trust in recommender systems. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate stability of several popular recommendation algorithms. Our results suggest that model-based recommendation techniques demonstrate higher stability than memory-based collaborative filtering heuristics. We also find that the stability measure for recommendation techniques is influenced by many factors, including the sparsity of the initial rating data, the number of new incoming ratings (representing the length of the time period over which the stability is being measured), the distribution of the newly added rating values, and the rating normalization procedures employed by the recommendation algorithms."

    "title": "Guest Editorial-Learning and Knowledge Analytics",
    "abstract": "The early stages of the internet and world wide web drew attention to the communication and connective capacities of global networks. The ability to collaborate and interact with colleagues from around the world provided academics with models of teaching and learning. Today, online education is a fast growing segment of the education sector. A side effect, to date not well explored, of digital learning is the collection of data and analytics in order to understand and inform teaching and learning. As learners engage in online or mobile learning, data trails are created. These data trails indicate social networks, learning dispositions, and how different learners come to understand core course concepts. Aggregate and large-scale data can also provide predictive value about the types of learning patterns and activity that might indicate risk of failure or drop out. The Society for Learning Analytics Research defines learning analytics as the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (http://www.solaresearch.org/mission/about/). As numerous papers in this issue reference, data analytics has drawn the attention of academics and academic leaders. High expectations exist for learning analytics to provide insights into educational practices and ways to improve teaching, learning, and decision-making. The appropriateness of these expectations is the subject of researchers in the young but rapidly growing learning analytics field. Learning analytics currently sits at a crossroads between technical and social learning theory fields. On the one hand, the algorithms that form recommender systems, personalization models, and network analysis require deep technical expertise. The impact of these algorithms, however, is felt in the social system of learning. As a consequence, researchers in learning analytics have devoted significant attention to bridging these gaps and bringing these communities in contact with each other through conversations and conferences. The LAK12 conference in Vancouver, for example, included invited panels and presentations from the educational data mining community. The SoLAR steering committee also includes representation from the International Educational Data mining Society (http://www.educationaldatamining.org). This issue reflects the rapid maturation of learning analytics as a domain of research. The papers in this issue indicate LA as a field with potential for improving teaching and learning. Less clear, currently, is the long-term trajectory of LA as a discipline. LA borrows from numerous fields including computer science, sociology, learning sciences, machine learning, statistics, and big data. Coalescing as a field will require leadership, openness, collaboration, and a willingness for researchers to approach learning analytics as a holistic process that includes both technical and social domains. This issue includes ten articles: Buckingham Shum and Fergusson describe social learning analytics (SLA) as a subset of learning analytics. SLA is concerned with the process of learning, instead of heavily favoring summative assessment. SLA emphasizes that new skills and ideas are not solely individual achievements, but are developed, carried forward, and passed on through interaction and collaboration. As a consequence, analytics in social systems must account for connected and distributed interaction activity. Hung, Hsu, and Rice explore the role of data mining in K-12 online education program reviews, providing educators with institutional decision-making support, in addition to identifying the characteristics of successful and at-risk students. Greller and Drachsler propose a generic framework for learning analytics, intended to serve as a guide in setting up LA services within an educational institution. \u2026"

The first one is about the learner's requirement and the second one in about the personalized recommendation technique. Finally, this study proposes the knowledge based recommendation system as suitable recommendation technique. This recommendation aims to recommend to the learner, some materials based on the learner's need. By using the semantic relationship between learning materials and the learner's need, system can select the suitable materials as a recommendation to the learner. To develop the proposed knowledge based recommendation system is the next work for the future."

Collaborative recommenders leverage the preferences of communities of similar users in order to guide the search for relevant items. The success of collaborative recommendation has always been restrained by the so-called sparsity problem, in which a lack of available user similarity knowledge ultimately limits the formation of high-quality user communities and has a subsequent impact on recommender accuracy. This article presents an approach to addressing the sparsity problem by describing and evaluating how implicit similarity knowledge can be discovered and exploited using data-mining techniques and an approach to recommendation that is inspired by case-based reasoning research."

It requires users to upload their personal preferences to the recommender for performing MF, which raises serious privacy concerns. This paper proposes a differentially private MF mechanism that can prevent an untrusted recommender from learning any users' ratings or profiles. Our design decouples computations upon users' private data from the recommender to users, and makes the recommender aggregate local results in a privacy-preserving way. It uses the objective perturbation to make sure that the final item profiles satisfy differential privacy and solves the challenge to decompose the noise component for objective perturbation into small pieces that can be determined locally and independently by users. We also propose a third-party based mechanism to reduce noises added in each iteration and adapt our online algorithm to the dynamic setting that allows users to leave and join. The experiments show that our proposal is efficient and introduces acceptable side effects on the precision of results."

This paper focuses on a different scenario: the user is supposed to be able to access content from multiple providers, in our application they offer radio channels, and it is up to a personal recommender installed on the clients' side to decide which channel to select and recommend to the user. We exploit the implicit feedback derived from the user's listening behavior, and we model channel recommendation as a sequential decision making problem. We have implemented a personal RS that integrates reinforcement learning techniques to decide what channel to play every time the user asks for a new music track or the current track finishes playing. In a live user study we show that the proposed system can sequentially select the next channel to play such that the users listen to the streamed tracks for a larger fraction, and for more time, compared to a baseline system not exploiting implicit feedback."

The system offers a better recommendation transparency and user-driven fusion through recommended sources. The experiment result shows the user did fuse the different recommended sources and exploration patterns among tasks.

Then the job recommendations to the target candidate are made on the basis of content based matching as well as candidate preferences, which are preserved either in the form of mined rules or obtained by candidate's own applied jobs history. Through this technique a significant level of accuracy has been achieved over other basic methods of job recommendations."
