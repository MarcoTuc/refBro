       "[[{'abstract': 'There is an explosion of interest in dynamical systems in the mathematical community as well as in many areas of science. The results have been truly exciting: systems which once seemed completely intractable from an analytic point of view can now be understood in a geometric or qualitative sense rather easily. Scientists and engineers realize the power and the beauty of the geometric and qualitative techniques. These techniques apply to a number of important nonlinear problems ranging from physics and chemistry to ecology and economics. Computer graphics have allowed us to view the dynamical behavior geometrically. The appearance of incredibly beautiful and intricate objects such as the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set, and other fractals have really piqued interest in the field. This is text is aimed primarily at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.&nbsp; Throughout, the author emphasizes the mathematical aspects of the theory of discrete dynamical systems, not the many and diverse applications of this theory. The field of dynamical systems and especially the study of chaotic systems has been hailed as one of the important breakthroughs in science in the past century and its importance continues to expand. There is no question that the field is becoming more and more important in a variety of scientific disciplines. New to this edition: •Greatly expanded coverage complex dynamics now in Chapter 2•The third chapter is now devoted to higher dimensional dynamical systems.•Chapters 2 and 3 are independent of one another.•New exercises have been added throughout.',\n",

To understand a dynamical system means to know how its states vary through time — at least to describe their variation, at best to predict it. Mathematical dynamical systems theory had its inception with Newton. Ever since G. D. Birkhoff, dynamical systems theory in the mathematical sense has meant the study of the long run behavior of solutions to differential equations in which one variable is thought of as time. There is an interesting class of dynamical systems which are guaranteed to be nonchaotic, and which can usually be easily recognized. A major challenge to mathematicians is to determine which dynamical systems are chaotic and which are not. Chaotic dynamical systems are sometimes said to have \"strange attractors\" or even \"strange strange attractors\". Such systems abound in models of hydrodynamics, mechanics, and many biological systems.',\n",

       "  {'abstract': 'This book gives a mathematical treatment of the introduction to qualitative differential equations and discrete dynamical systems. The treatment includes theoretical proofs, methods of calculation, and applications. The two parts of the book, continuous time of differential equations and discrete time of dynamical systems, can be covered independently in one semester each or combined together into a year long course. The material on differential equations introduces the qualitative or geometric approach through a treatment of linear systems in any dimensions. There follows chapters where equilibria are the most important feature, where scalar (energy) functions is the principal tool, where periodic orbits appear, and finally chaotic systems of differential equations. The many different approaches are systematically introduced through examples and theorems. The material on discrete dynamical systems starts with maps of one variable and proceeds to systems in higher dimensions. The treatment starts with examples where the periodic points can be found explicitly and then introduces symbolic dynamics to analyze where they can be shown to exist but not given in explicit form. Chaotic systems are presented both mathematically and more computationally using Lyapunov exponents. With the one-dimensional maps as models, the multidimensional maps cover the same material in higher dimensions. This higher dimensional material is less computational and more conceptual and theoretical. The final chapter on fractals introduces various dimensions which is another computational tool for measuring the complexity of a system. It also treats iterated function systems which give examples of complicated sets. In the second edition of the book, much of the material has been rewritten to clarify the presentation. Also, some new material has been included in both parts of the book. This book can be used as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate course on ordinary differential equations and/or dynamical systems. Prerequisites are standard courses in calculus (single variable and multivariable), linear algebra, and introductory differential equations.',\n",

These exponents govern the growth or decrease of small perturbations to orbits of a dynamical system. They are critical to the predictability of models made from observations as well as known analytic models. The Lyapunov exponents are invariants of the dynamical system and are connected with the dimension of the system attractor and to the idea of information generation by the system dynamics. Lyapunov exponents are among the many ways we can classify observed nonlinear systems, and their appeal to physicists remains their clear interpretation in terms of system stability and predictability. We discuss the familiar global Lyapunov exponents which govern the evolution of perturbations for long times and local Lyapunov exponents which determine the predictability over a finite number of time steps.',\n",
